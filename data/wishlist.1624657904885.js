The youngest daughter of the Master of the Wood lived in ramshackle Westwood Hall, in the independently minded Westwood estate of Sevendor. Her determination to capture a baby falcon and train it wasn’t hampered by the fact that Dara had never climbed a mountain, had never been trained in falconry, or even remotely had permission from her father to do it. Dara wanted the falcon...and the only thing in her way was the mountain, an angry mother falcon, and her own fears.</p> <p>But the daring climb up Rundeval and actually capturing the fledgling falcon is just the beginning of her troubles. Actually learning falconry and training the willful bird is a responsibility she had barely considered. Worse, there is trouble afoot in the domain: A new lord has come to rule over Sevendor and all of her people, replacing the corrupt old Sir Erantal. While everyone welcomes the change, the new lord is a wizard: a magelord, the first of his kind in 400 years: Lord Minalan the Spellmonger. And he’s not alone. He’s brought thousands of oddly dressed Wilderlanders with him, families escaping the wars in the west...and settling in Sevendor.</p> <p>Within weeks of holding his first court as lord of Sevendor, the wizard's magic begins to cause problems. Magelord Minalan turns Sevendor Castle, the entire mountain of Rundeval, and a good portion of the Westwood - including Dara’s home - into enchanted white stone when a spell goes unexpectedly awry one fateful night. As a result, Dara learns that she, too, may become a mage someday. Soon after she discovers that she can see through her falcon’s eyes and share her thoughts, the talents of a beastmaster, opening up a brilliant new world for her.</p> <p>The folk of the valley have enough to eat for the first time in a generation, there are wizards all over Sevendor, and the castle glows with a magic light at night. The fortunes of the Westwood estate rise. But the Magelord finds foes as well as friends in Sevendor.</p> <p>Though prosperity flows from the Magelord’s benevolent rule, the changes are frightening to some who have lost power since the Magelord came. Outside the Westwood, the other natives of the domain are upset by their magical lord and his strange new people, and there are whispers of rebellion. And outside of the domain, the neighboring lords, urged on by sinister forces, conspire to plunge Sevendor into war - with Dara and her family along with it!</p> <p>What can one girl and her falcon do?

On the shore of Lake Superior, a man named Vladimir Oleshev is found shot dead, three holes in his head and heart, and though nobody knows why he was killed, everybody - the local cops, the FBI, and the Russians themselves - has a theory. And when it turns out he had very high government connections, that's when it hits the fan. A Russian cop flies in from Moscow, Davenport flies in from Minneapolis, law enforcement and press types swarm the crime scene - and, in the middle of it all, there is another murder. Is there a relationship between the two? What is the Russian cop hiding from Davenport? Is she - yes, it's a woman - a cop at all? Why was the man shot with ... fifty-year-old bullets? Before he can find the answers, Davenport will have to follow a trail back to another place, another time, and battle the shadows he discovers there - shadows that turn out to be both very real and very deadly.</p>","title":"Hidden Prey: Prey","titleShort":"Hidden Prey"},{"added":597,"asin":"B003IX58DU","authors":[{"name":"James Rollins","url":"B001H6U9DE"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"cover":"61I+xmGsJKL","dateAdded":"2020-11-30","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"16h 17m ","narrators":[{"name":"John Meagher"}],"publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"rating":4.1,"ratings":3340,"releaseDate":"2010-05-04","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/002170/bk_harp_002170_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B0070XZNG6","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Sigma Force"}],"summary":"<p>An inexplicable explosion rocks the antiquities collection of a London museum, and the race begins to determine how it happened, why it happened, and what it means.</p> <p>Lady Kara Kensington's family paid a high price in money and blood to found the gallery that now lies in ruins.

These resisters are sterilized by the Ooloi so that they cannot reproduce the genetic defect that drives humanity to destroy itself, but otherwise they are left alone (unless they become violent). When the resisters kidnap young Akin, the Oankali choose to leave the child with his captors, for he the most \"human\" of the Oankali children will decide whether the resisters should be given back their fertility and freedom, even though they will only destroy themselves again. </p> <p>This is the second volume in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis series, a powerful tale of alien existence. </p>","title":"Adulthood Rites: Xenogenesis, Book 2","titleShort":"Adulthood Rites"},{"added":553,"asin":"B074PXFZFX","authors":[{"name":"Orson Scott Card","url":"B000AQ3SS0"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51xBs7jHfwL","dateAdded":"2020-10-15","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"11h 37m ","narrators":[{"name":"Stefan Rudnicki"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Macmillan Audio"}],"rating":4.4,"ratings":1736,"releaseDate":"2017-10-10","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/aren/002615/bk_aren_002615_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B0756TVDWN","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Children of the Fleet"}],"summary":"<p>\"The ideal presentation of any book of mine is to have excellent actors perform it in audio-only format.\" - Orson Scott Card </p> <p>This program is read by Stefan Rudnicki and a full cast including Emily Rankin, Kirby Heyborne, Orson Scott Card, P.J.

There she finds that her scumbag dad had actually, in the final years of his life, put his amazing talent for hustling to good use: He was one of the founding members of the Fancy Suits and died in the course of his duties. Zoey is quickly entangled in the city's surreal mob war when she is taken hostage by a particularly crazy villain who imagines himself to be a Dr. Doom-level mastermind. The villain is demanding information about Zoe's father when she is rescued by The Fancy Suits. She reluctantly joins their cause and helps finish what her old man started, tapping in to her innate talent for bullshit that she inherited from her hated father. And along the way, she might just have to learn how to trust people again. </p>","title":"Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits","titleShort":"Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits"},{"added":308,"asin":"B00BNGW61Q","authors":[{"name":"Jasper Fforde","url":"B000APXZAC"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"cover":"6102X5PUSnL","dateAdded":"2019-08-01","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"9h 10m ","narrators":[{"name":"Gabrielle Kruger"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Hodder & Stoughton"}],"rating":4.2,"ratings":114,"releaseDate":"2013-03-11","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hodd/000535/bk_hodd_000535_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B006K1T2JI","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Thursday Next Novels"}],"summary":"<p>There is another 1985, somewhere in the could-have-been, where the Crimean war still rages, dodos are regenerated in home-cloning kits and everyone is deeply disappointed by the ending of 'Jane Eyre'.</p> <p>In this world there are no jet-liners or computers, but there are policemen who can travel across time, a Welsh republic, a great interest in all things literary - and a woman called Thursday Next.</p> <p>In this utterly original and wonderfully funny first novel, Fforde has created a fiesty, loveable heroine and a plot of such richness and ingenuity that it will take your breath away.</p>","title":"The Eyre Affair","titleShort":"The Eyre Affair"},{"added":307,"asin":"B005E1GAU4","authors":[{"name":"Oliver Pötzsch","url":"B0028YWZ4U"},{"name":"Lee Chadeayne - translator","url":"/search"}],"categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"51sPZv80v1L","dateAdded":"2019-07-28","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"12h 57m ","narrators":[{"name":"Grover Gardner"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Brilliance Audio"}],"rating":4,"ratings":4787,"releaseDate":"2011-08-02","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/003086/bk_brll_003086_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B008AW0L1I","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"A Hangman's Daughter Tale"}],"summary":"<p>Germany, 1660: When a dying boy is pulled from the river with a mark crudely tattooed on his shoulder, hangman Jakob Kuisl is called upon to investigate whether witchcraft is at play in his small Bavarian town.

Nor will he tell her what he does back home, and how he can afford to stay in a house in one of London's best streets. So when she reads about an American outlaw known as the Dark Rider arriving in England, she suspects Mr. Glass is the fugitive. When danger comes to their door, she's certain of it. But if she notifies the authorities, she'll find herself unemployed and homeless again - and she will have betrayed the man who saved her life. With a cast of quirky characters, an intriguing mystery, and a dash of romance, <i>The Watchmaker's Daughter</i> is the start of a thrilling new historical fantasy series from the author of the best-selling <i>Ministry of Curiosities</i>, <i>Freak House</i>, and the Emily Chambers Spirit Medium books. </p>","title":"The Watchmaker's Daughter: Glass and Steele, Book 1","titleShort":"The Watchmaker's Daughter"},{"added":205,"asin":"1977383440","authors":[{"name":"Will Thomas","url":"B001H6OA7K"}],"categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"51aFO3hjekL","dateAdded":"2018-12-25","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"9h 1m ","narrators":[{"name":"Antony Ferguson"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"rating":4.7,"ratings":567,"releaseDate":"2018-11-13","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/013671/bk_tant_013671_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B01N0TCUEW","bookNumbers":["10"],"name":"Barker & Llewelyn Series"}],"summary":"<p>In 19th-century London, Cyrus Barker and his associate Thomas Llewelyn are renowned private enquiry agents, successfully employed by the highest levels of Her Majesty's government as well as private citizens.

He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away: a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life - like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963 - turning on a dime. </p> <p>Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession - to prevent the Kennedy assassination. </p> <p>So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world - of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading, eventually of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful - and where history might not be history anymore.

What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral complexity of a true epic.</p> <p>For hundreds of thousands of fans who heard <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are listening to <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p> <p>Cover artwork ©2020 CBS Interactive Inc.</p>","title":"The Stand","titleShort":"The Stand"},{"added":100,"asin":"B00F0XOWY2","authors":[{"name":"Michael J.
