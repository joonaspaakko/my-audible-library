window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Michael Sloan, co-creator of the classic 1980s TV show </b><b><i>The Equalizer</i></b><b>—now reimagined in a series starring Queen Latifah—presents an original story of the mysterious, former covert intelligence officer who helps desperate people who are in need of his unique and deadly skills.</b></p> <p><i>“Got a problem? Odds against you? Call the Equalizer.”</i><br> <br> Robert McCall is a former covert operations officer for the CIA who tries to atone for past sins by offering, free of charge, his services as a protector, an investigator, and a troubleshooter—often literally. Aided by a group of sometimes-mysterious contacts, some of whom date back to his spying days, McCall traverses the streets of New York City, visiting justice upon those who prey upon the weak.<br> <br> A woman finds herself the target of a Chechen nightclub owner. The club is actually a front for an elite assassination service—run by an old enemy of McCall’s. To save his client’s life, the Equalizer is going to have to confront the sins of his past…</p>";
