She had no memory of how she died. That was also new; before, when she had awakened as a new clone, her first memory was of how she died. Maria's vat was in the front of six vats, each one holding the clone of a crew member of the starship <i>Dormire</i>, each clone waiting for its previous incarnation to die so it could awaken. And Maria wasn't the only one to die recently.... </p>";
