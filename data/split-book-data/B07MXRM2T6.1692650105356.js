When a methed-out vampire (and family friend) goes on a road-trip rampage, Hunter and his kin pack up the truck and follow the trail of corpses all the way to San Francisco.</p> <p>This reality-TV style story feels like a combination of<i> Dog the Bounty Hunter</i> meets <i>Ghostbusters </i>meets <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>. Hunter's war journal is a mix of tawdry laughs and gut-churning horror.</p>";
