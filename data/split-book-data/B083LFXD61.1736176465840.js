window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To-do list: Cow tip the Minotaur. Cure a reptile dysfunction.</b></p> <p>My name is Nate Temple, and I’m secretly a wizard. I ride a foul-mouthed unicorn, drink with Achilles, and am pals with the Four Horsemen. I’ve even cow tipped the Minotaur. I understand the theory of following the rules. I’m just not very good at the application.</p> <p>Because, rules were meant to be broken. Especially when I find out a monster just murdered my parents. </p> <p>Now all I can hear is the sweet, soothing song of vengeance in my ears, playing on repeat.</p> <p>But when shifter dragons come to town, I’m forced to step away from hunting down the scumbag murderer. Because, I know the cure for a reptile dysfunction and the dragons aren’t going to like it.</p> <p>This fight soon opens up Pandora’s Box, and suddenly, every flavor of supernatural thug is after me. The only way out of it - to save my city - is to murder my best friend.</p> <p>I didn’t want, ask for, or start any of this. But I will <i>finish</i> it. It’s time I show St. Louis that magic is very, very real. And that an angry wizard is truly something to see - at least once in your life. You know, right before he puts you and everyone you've ever met in the grave.</p> <p><b>If you like Jim Butcher, Sarah J. Maas, Kevin Hearne, Steve McHugh, Michael Anderle, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Shannon Mayer, or K.F. Breene, you won't be able to put down the highly addictive Nate Temple Series.</b></p>";
