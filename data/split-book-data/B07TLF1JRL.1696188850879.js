window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He's big.<br> He's dumb.<br> He's heavily armed.<br> He's hilarious!</p> <p>For the first time in one audiobook set, this box set collects Seasons 1-3 of the popular Bubba the Monster Hunter series, from the author of The Black Knight Chronicles and Quincy Harker, Demon Hunter.</p> <p>Robert \"Bubba\" Brabham never wanted to hunt monsters. He mostly wanted to drink beer, hunt deer, and chase women, like every other giant redneck in the world. But life interfered, and Bubba found himself holster-deep in the family business: monster hunting.</p> <p>Now he's the Southeastern Regional Hunter for the Holy Roman Catholic Church, and along with his technical wizard and best friend Skeeter, his Knight Templar liaison Uncle Father Joe (because he's Skeeter's uncle, and he's a priest) and his...girlfriend (?) Agent Amy Hall of DEMON, a shady government agency with a ridiculous name just so it can spell out something cool, Bubba has to save the world from the things that go bump in the night!</p> <p>Just as soon as he's done with his beer. And maybe after one more lap dance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fans of <i>Tucker &amp; Dale versus Evil</i>, <i>Cabin in the Woods</i>, or <i>Ash vs the Evil Dead</i> will love this comedy/horror/urban fantasy collection, with three full collections in one box set!</p> <p>This collection includes:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Scattered, Smothered, &amp; Chunked: Bubba the Monster Hunter Season One</i></li> <li><i>Grits, Guns, &amp; Glory: Bubba the Monster Hunter Season Two</i></li> <li><i>Wine, Women, &amp; Song: Bubba the Monster Hunter Season Three</i></li> </ul>";
