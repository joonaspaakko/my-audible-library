window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new life begins....</b></p> <p>As his 18th birthday approaches, the only thing that Xander Stryker wishes for - is death.</p> <p>Yet, he wakes up each morning, forced to go on living and remembering the image of his stepfather murdering his mother. Instead of dying, he is thrown into a supernatural world and offered a choice: Continue his sorry life or start anew.</p> <p>For Xander, the choice is obvious. In the new world, life is just as unforgiving. Horrors from his past lurk from the shadows. His self-destructive urges creep back. Old rage. New bloodlust. As they fuel a fresh legacy, Xander has to stand tall and show old monsters a stronger, better version of himself.</p> <p><b>If you like grit, horror, and compelling character chemistry, take a bite out of the dark supernatural series by Nathan Squiers.</b></p>";
