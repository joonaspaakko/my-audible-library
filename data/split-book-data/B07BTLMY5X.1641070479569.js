window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Brandon Sanderson comes a new novella collection, including a brand-new, never-been-published story.</b></p> <p>Stephen Leeds is perfectly sane. It's his hallucinations who are mad.</p> <p>A genius of unrivaled aptitude, Stephen can learn any new skill, vocation, or art in a matter of hours. However, to contain all of this, his mind creates hallucinatory people - Stephen calls them aspects - to hold and manifest the information. Wherever he goes, he is joined by a team of imaginary experts to give advice, interpretation, and explanation. He uses them to solve problems...for a price.</p> <p>His brain is getting a little crowded and the aspects have a tendency of taking on lives of their own. When a company hires him to recover stolen property - a camera that can allegedly take pictures of the past - Stephen finds himself in an adventure crossing oceans and fighting terrorists. What he discovers may upend the foundation of three major world religions - and, perhaps, give him a vital clue into the true nature of his aspects.</p> <p><i>Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds</i> includes the novellas <i>Legion</i> and <i>Legion: Skin Deep,</i> published together for the first time, as well as a brand-new Stephen Leeds novella, <i>Lies of the Beholder.</i></p>";
