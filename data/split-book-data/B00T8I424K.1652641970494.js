window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author R. A. Salvatore takes listeners back to his signature world of Corona, introducing a fascinating new hero. It is God's year 54, many years before the Demon Wars, in the land of Corona. The roads are unsafe to travel; goblins and bloodthirsty Powries search out human prey. Two religions struggle fiercely for control. Bran Dynard, a monk of the fledgling religion of Abelle, returns from his mission in a far-off land with a book of mystical knowledge and a beautiful and mysterious new wife. But he soon realizes that the world he left behind has changed, and his dream of spreading the wisdom he learned to his fellow monks is crushed. </p> <p>Forced to hide his wife and his precious book, Bran must decide whom he can trust and where he should now place his faith. Twenty years later, the situation has grown darker and more desperate. Only the Highwayman travels freely, his sword casting aside both Powries and soldiers. The people need a savior, but is the Highwayman on a mission of mercy... or vengeance? </p>";
