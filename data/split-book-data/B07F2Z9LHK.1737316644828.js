window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A shackled Earth, ruled by an unstoppable tyrant. An exiled son, and a one-way trip across the galaxy. A perfect world, their last hope for survival.</p> <p>Vice admiral Isaac Gallant is the heir apparent to the First Admiral, the dictator of the Confederacy of Humanity. Unwilling to let his mother’s tyranny stand, he joins the rebellion and leads his ships into war against the might of his own nation.</p> <p>Betrayal and failure, however, see Isaac Gallant and his allies captured. Rather than execute her only son, the First Admiral instead decides to exile them, flinging four million dissidents and rebels through a one-shot wormhole to the other end of the galaxy.</p> <p>There, Isaac finds himself forced to keep order and peace as they seek out a new home without becoming the very dictator he fought against - and when that new home turns out to be too perfect to be true, he and his fellow exiles must decide how hard they are prepared to fight for paradise… against the very people who built it.</p>";
