window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fallen angels take residence in Infertat’s Golden City after their banishment from Verdigrid. Lucifer and his kin establish their rule over the city’s human inhabitants as a symbol of defiance to the Eternal and angelic army that cast them down. They gather humans without any magical abilities and put them to hard manual labor in the slums across the Chasm. These slums are home to Priya, a young woman who discovers a secret within herself which can hinder Lucifer’s plans and help the human resistance take back their city from the daemons. That is, if she can take control of the hungry beast within herself.</p> <p>Sul is an ambitious magus in the Golden City, Zack has just gotten accepted to a prestigious Ivy League university in New York City. Azul has never been happy with his life in Verdigrid and Sammael, the angel of death, a keeper of the balance feels uneasy.</p> <p>Seemingly unrelated, many threads of fate run parallel to one another. It is only a matter of time until they converge and hold the fate of the worlds in their hands.</p>";
