window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Enter the Execration,</b></p> <p><b>Where the Damned and the Desperate </b></p> <p><b>Come to Pray to the Mad God....</b></p> <p>It is 200 years since the deity known as the Absolved went mad and destroyed the Kingdom of Alnachim, transforming it into the Execration, a blasted wasteland filled with nameless terrors. For decades, desperate souls have made pilgrimage to the centre of this cursed land to seek the Mad God’s favour, their fate always unknown.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now a veteran warrior known only as Pilgrim, armed with a fabled blade inhabited by the soul of a taunting demon, must join with six others to make the last journey to the heart of the Execration. Allied with a youthful priest, a beast-charmer, a duplicitous scholar, an effete actor, and two exiled lovers, Pilgrim must survive madness, malevolent spirits, unnatural monsters, and the ever-present risk of treachery, all so that the Mad God might hear his prayer and, perhaps, grant redemption. But can sins such as his ever be forgiven?&nbsp;</p> <p>Set in a world where demons and gods walk the earth, <i>A Pilgrimage of Swords</i> is a dark and exciting fantasy adventure from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Raven’s Shadow and Draconis Memoria trilogies.</p>";
