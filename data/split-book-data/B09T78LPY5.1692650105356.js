window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine <i>Back to the Future</i> entwined with the havoc-wreaking presence of an alien invader and the storytelling finesse reminiscent of John Scalzi or Octavia Butler.</p> <p>What fun is time travel when there’s a shape-shifting alien trying to kill you, your best friend is a ghost, and you can’t seem to escape even yourself for long? One man sees the future; another is trying to destroy it.</p> <p>After a brush with death at the tender age of nine, Faer Michelson has a near-perfect autobiographical memory. He has a good life, loving wife, and he's only mildly concerned about Y2K. Sure, no one else remembers Bobby Kennedy was president or that time an alien took over the TV to declare war, but what's that in the grand scheme of things? Then one day, Faer remembers something that he can't shrug off: his own death in <a href=\"http://1968.it/\">1968.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://1968.it/\">It</a> turns out, the Time Warp isn't just a song in <i>Rocky Horror</i>. Faer finds himself stranded in the past with a shape-shifting alien and an apparition of his best friend. An unearthly decree is made before Faer can sort out how to get home: save yourself, then save the world.</p>";
