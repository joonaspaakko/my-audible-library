window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the authors of the number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>Rhett &amp; Link's Book of Mythicality </i></b><b>and creators of the internet’s most-watched daily show, </b><b><i>Good Mythical Morning</i></b><b>, a thrilling and darkly funny novel about two best friends fighting the sinister forces at the heart of their Southern town.</b></p> <p>It's 1992 in Bleak Creek, North Carolina, a sleepy little place with all the trappings of an ordinary Southern town: two Baptist churches, friendly smiles coupled with silent judgments, and a seemingly unquenchable appetite for pork products. Beneath the town’s cheerful façade, however, Bleak Creek teens live in constant fear of being sent to The Whitewood School, a local reformatory with a record of putting unruly teens back on the straight and narrow - a record so impeccable that almost everyone is willing to ignore the mysterious deaths that have occurred there over the past decade.</p> <p>At first, high school freshmen Rex McClendon and Leif Nelson believe what they’ve been told - that the students’ strange demises were all tragic accidents. But when the shoot for their low-budget horror masterpiece, <i>PolterDog</i>, goes horribly awry - and their best friend, Alicia Boykins, is sent to Whitewood as punishment - Rex and Leif are forced to question everything they know about their unassuming hometown and its cherished school for delinquents.</p> <p>Eager to rescue their friend, Rex and Leif pair up with recent NYU film school grad Janine Blitstein to begin piecing together the unsettling truth of the school and its mysterious founder, Wayne Whitewood. What they find, with Alicia's life hanging in the balance, will leave them battling an evil beyond their wildest teenage imaginations - one that will shake Bleak Creek to its core.</p> <p>This Audible book includes an exclusive interview with Rhett and Link, conducted by Stevie Levine, host of the <i>Good Mythical Morning</i> recap show, <i>Let's Talk About That</i>. In this conversation, Rhett and Link dive into their childhoods in Buies Creek and how they influenced their lives and writing.</p> <p><b>About the authors:</b></p> <p>Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, raised in North Carolina and best friends since the first grade, are an LA-based comedy duo known for hosting the most-watched daily talk show on the internet, <i>Good Mythical Morning</i>, their narrative series <i>Rhett &amp; Link's Buddy System</i>, the award-winning weekly podcast <i>Ear Biscuits</i>, and their instant number-one <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>Rhett &amp; Link's Book of Mythicality</i>.
