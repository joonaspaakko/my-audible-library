I’m done serving tricksters, gods, and fae, and now it’s time to attend to personal matters.</p> <p>Priority number one? Fulfilling my master's dream by rebuilding the druid order.</p> <p>Since the fall of the druids 2,000 years ago, the gods, vampires, and fae have wreaked havoc on humanity. It's time for that reign of terror to end.</p> <p>But if I’m to restore the druids to their former glory, I’ll need a safe place to train my recruits. Ideally, someplace where they won’t get curb-stomped by the gods.</p> <p>I can’t think of a better place to hide out than an alternate timeline where the gods and fae are too busy fighting a civil war to bother with little old me. So, it’s time to head back, settle old scores, clear the alternate timeline Earth of the undead, and plant some new druid groves.</p> <p>This time, I’m ready for those bloodsucking bastards. With a powerful werewolf alpha and the world’s saltiest necromancer at my side, the vampires won’t know what hit them.</p> <p>After I finish that business, who knows? Maybe I’ll take a vacation, and possibly even settle down.</p> <p>But first, I have some serious vampire slaying to do—about three million of them.</p> <p>Nobody ever said being a druid master would be easy…</p> <p>- - -</p> <p><i>Deadlands Druid</i> is an urban fantasy thrill ride through an alternate history, post-apocalyptic version of The Lonestar State.</p> <p>If you enjoy paranormal action and adventure novels that are full of magic, vampires, werewolves, and wizards, you’ll love this entry in the Sylvan Cycle Series.</p> <p>Get your copy today and find out what 250,000+ book lovers already know...that M.D. Massey’s Druidverse is a world tailor-made for fans of urban fantasy.</p>";
