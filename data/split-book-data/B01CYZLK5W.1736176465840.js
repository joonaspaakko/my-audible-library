window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Humanity isn't all they left behind. </p> <p>Two years later, the world lives in fragile peace. But a clandestine search has begun...and a clock has started ticking. </p> <p>Two years after first contact, Astral forces have established their fragile kingdom around the globe. Motherships occupy the cities. Shuttles patrol the lawless outlands. The pacifist class of Astrals known as Titans assist humans in running their alien empire while bloodthirsty Reptar peacekeepers ensure that order is kept. And unseen in the ships above, a third class of visitor calls the shots - the unseen Divinity, worshipped and feared by citizens in equal measure. </p> <p>Meyer Dempsey sits on his plinth as Viceroy of Heaven's Veil, on the old site of Vail, Colorado. As with other Viceroys in the eight other world capitals, humanity's remains revere Meyer almost as a god. But below the surface, both colonies and outlands have begun to crumble with unrest. </p> <p>Until now the rebellion has been quiet. Now desperation bubbles as they learn the Astrals have begun digging for an ancient device buried beneath the glowing blue Apex at Heaven's Veil. </p> <p>But twin truths of the forthcoming alien war (or a possible alien apocalypse) have dawned at Benjamin Bannister's facility in Moab, sending plans into action: The Astrals have lost what they hoped to uncover. </p> <p>And humanity's only chance is to find it first. </p>";
