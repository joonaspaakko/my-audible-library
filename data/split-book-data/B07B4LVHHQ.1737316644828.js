window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Black Friday</i>, book 1: </p> <p>In his junior year at college, the only things on Sean's mind are doing his homework and getting out of college to get a real job. A gamer and a bit of a nerd, Sean's philosophy in life has been to keep his head down and get his work done: He doesn't have the time or money for anything more after his father died in an industrial accident when Sean was eight. </p> <p>But when a failed kidnapping attempt leaves him with a gaping hole in his memory, his oldest friend dead, and his mother missing, Sean suddenly finds his whole world turned upside down as he's thrust into the hidden world of magic and the supernatural. Apparently he's now wanted, dead or alive, by all of the magical societies, though he has no idea why. About the only thing going for him is what his friend did for him just before he died and the cute track star who lives in the room next to his, who has suddenly taken a very personal interest in his problems. </p> <p><i>Perfect Strangers</i>, book 2: </p> <p>During his junior year in college, Sean finds himself suddenly dropped into the middle of a world that he didn't even know existed. A secret world of magic and magic users, lycanthropes, goblins, and all the other things that go bump in the night. To make matters even more difficult, the very same magic users who had Sean's father killed now believe that Sean will somehow inherit his father's work when he turns 21, which is just a few days away. </p> <p>Needless to say most of the magic users' councils seem to be in two camps: The first camp wants him dead. The second camp wants him captured and will probably kill him after they've learned his secrets. The only solution Sean sees to any of this is to finish his father's work, the very thing that got his father killed. But in order to do that, Sean must first find out just what his father was working on! He's also going to need to learn magic himself, find a safe place to stay, raise some money, and gain a lot of allies. </p> <p>Fortunately for Sean he's got two good women at his side: Roxy, a cheetah lycanthrope with a lot of experience in fighting; and Jolene, a tantric witch with more than a few connections in the supernatural black market. </p> <p>WARNING: <i>The Valens Legacy</i> contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, bad language, attempted murder, actual murder, self-defense, proactive self-defense, destruction of private property, vandalism, breaking and entering, tantric magic, polyamory, mayhem, gratuitous sex and violence, littering, breaking speed limits, a used car dealer, one Plymouth hemi, and some poor guy who just wants to earn a paycheck as a cashier. </p>";
