window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the creators of the number one podcast</b> <b><i>Limetown</i></b><b>, an explosive prequel about a teenager who learns of a mysterious research facility where over 300 people have disappeared - including her uncle - with clues that become the key to discovering the secrets of this strange town.</b></p> <p>On a seemingly ordinary day, 17-year-old Lia Haddock hears news that will change her life forever: 300 men, women, and children living at a research facility in Limetown, Tennessee, have disappeared without a trace. Among the missing is Emile Haddock, Lia’s uncle.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened to the people of Limetown? It’s all anyone can talk about. Except Lia’s parents, who refuse to discuss what might have happened there. They refuse, even, to discuss anything to do with Emile.</p> <p>As a student journalist, Lia begins an investigation that will take her far from her home, discovering clues about Emile’s past that lead to a shocking secret - one with unimaginable implications not only for the people of Limetown, but for Lia and her family. The only problem is...she’s not the only one looking for answers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie are first-rate storytellers in every medium. Critics called their podcast <i>Limetown</i> “creepy and otherworldly” (<i>The New York Times</i>) and “endlessly fun” (<i>Vox</i>), and their novel goes back to where it all began. Working with Cote Smith, a PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize finalist, they’ve crafted an exhilarating mystery that asks big questions about what we owe to our families and what we owe to ourselves, about loss, discovery, and growth. Threaded throughout is Emile’s story - told here for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>";
