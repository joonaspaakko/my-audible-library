window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's not easy being a house that eats people.</p> <p>Zaria was just a normal woman, living a simple life—until demons burst through her door and ate her heart. Reborn from tragedy, Zaria rises from the ashes as a Core, but with a twist. A rare mutation has turned her into a Mutant Core, destined to explode unless she forms a bond with a human witch to become a Striga.</p> <p>Her mutation? Legs.</p> <p>With the power of a full dungeon compressed into a walking house that is her body, Zaria sets out on a journey to find her Striga and avoid detonation. Along the way, she battles demons, builds her dungeon, and feeds her mimic mobs.</p> <p>This is not the life she once knew, but it's the one she's determined to make work, no matter who she has to walk through to get there.</p>";
