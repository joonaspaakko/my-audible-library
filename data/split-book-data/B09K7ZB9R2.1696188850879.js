As for my nights, they’re spent capturing the deadliest of supernatural creatures. I must have ingredients for my research, after all.</p> <p>Now, one of those creatures claims he witnessed my abduction. Yet, the supernatural races are a treacherous lot, and there’s little to convince me he’s telling the truth.</p> <p>But if there’s even a remote chance that my family is alive and well....</p> <p>I’ll cut a swathe of destruction through an army of Fae, if it means gaining back a piece of the humanity they stole from me.</p> <p>My name is Crowley, and if I can’t have my life back, then vengeance will have to do.</p> <p><b><i>Shade Cursed</i></b><b> is the first entry in The Shadow Changeling Series, a Colin McCool Junkyard Druid spin-off series set in M.D. Massey's Druidverse urban fantasy setting.</b></p> <p>If you enjoy dark urban fantasy books featuring haunted antiheroes in the tradition of Snape, Walker Boh, and Constantine, you'll love this story about a human changeling prince fighting to overcome the tragedy of his tortured past.</p> <p>Listen to the first title in this urban fantasy trilogy today!</p>";
