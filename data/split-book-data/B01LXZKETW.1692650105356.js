window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A spellbinding thriller from the bestselling author of <i>The Einstein Prophecy</i>.</b> </p> <p>A chilling curse is transported from 1880s London to present-day California, awakening a long-dormant fiend. </p> <p>While on routine patrol in the tinder-dry Topanga Canyon, environmental scientist Rafael Salazar expects to find animal poachers, not a dilapidated antique steamer trunk. Inside the peculiar case, he discovers a journal, written by the renowned Robert Louis Stevenson, which divulges ominous particulars about his creation of <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>. It also promises to reveal a terrible secret - the identity of Jack the Ripper. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the journal - whose macabre tale unfolds in an alternating narrative with Rafe's - isn't the only relic in the trunk, and Rafe isn't the only one to purloin a souvenir. A mysterious flask containing the last drops of the grisly potion that inspired <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> and spawned London's most infamous killer has gone missing. And it has definitely fallen into the wrong hands. </p>";
