window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Craig Alanson comes a thrilling new series that melds action-packed urban fantasy with his signature humor, read by none other than award-winning narrator R.C. Bray.</b></p> <p>My name is Kazimir Wolfe. People call me \"Kaz\", except they don’t. I never use my real name; it’s too dangerous, for me and for anyone I meet.</p> <p>I’m on the run from the law, who think I killed my aunt, and from whoever did kill her, because they want to finish the job. So, I move around a lot, working construction or whatever job I can find. It’s a lonely life. I don’t let anyone get close...people who get close to me end up dead. Why?</p> <p>I’m a wizard. The world’s only wizard, as far as I know. I don’t have a wand or a sword, and I don’t ride a dragon. I carry a Glock, and drive around in a beat-up RV with a talking dog.</p> <p>Yeah. The talking dog was a surprise to me, too. Duke is inhabited by the spirit of a 3,000-year-old wizard from Babylon, and he’s a good dog, but he is still a dog, and that’s a problem. Like, he still thinks squirrels are his mortal enemy. And that I don’t feed him enough. How did the spirit of a wizard reach across millennia, to our time? I don’t know.</p> <p>The truth is, I’m not much of a wizard, because there’s not much magic in the world for me to work with.&nbsp;But there <i>used</i> to be magic. And magic is coming back&nbsp;as our world converges with the Nether.</p> <p>Unless I can stop it.</p>";
