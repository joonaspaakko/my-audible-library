window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this action-packed sci-fi thriller from the bestselling author of the Sol Saga, a man is on a mission to stop his family’s killer&nbsp;no matter what—or when.</b></p> <p>Andrew Frost had been gone no more than fifteen minutes. It was just supposed to be a quick run to the store. But in that brief interval, his entire universe was stolen from him, every parent and spouse’s worst nightmare on display at the kitchen table upon his return.</p> <p>Two months later, he’d do anything to see Sylvia and Alison again.

It’s simply a matter of changing the past. Soon, he’s chasing after a killer with a shifting face, who has his sights set on Andrew’s wife and daughter. He can’t—he <i>won’t</i>—let them die again. But when the mysterious Clockmen are dispatched with orders to keep the timeline on track at any cost, it could mean the last grain of sand in the hourglass for Andrew, bringing his own time to an end.</p> <p>How far would you be willing to go—and what price would you pay—to save the ones you love?
