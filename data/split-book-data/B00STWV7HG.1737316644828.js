But her latest fanged foe may be above her pay grade. </p> <p>For centuries, the extremely powerful and ruthless vampire witches of the European Council have wandered the Earth, controlling governments, fostering war, creating political conflict, and often leaving absolute destruction in their wake. One of the strongest of them is set to create some havoc in the city of New Orleans, and it's definitely personal. </p> <p>Jane is tasked with tracking him down.
