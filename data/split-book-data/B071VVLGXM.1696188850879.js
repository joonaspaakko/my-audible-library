Jillian Guthrie, a troubled young journalist, stumbles onto a tantalizing mystery: the same man, unaged, stands alongside Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, and Gandhi in three different photographs spanning eighty-five years of history. </p> <p>In another part of town, Will - an enigmatic thirty-three-year-old of immense charm, wit, and intelligence - looks forward to the new year with hope and trepidation. Haunted by his secret past and shadowed by a dangerous stranger, he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt spearheaded by an ambitious Vatican emissary and an elderly former UN envoy named Hanna. </p> <p>During the next forty-eight hours, a catastrophic event unites Will, Jillian, and Hanna - and puts them in the crosshairs of a centuries-old international conspiracy. Together, the three must unravel an ancient curse that stretches back two millennia and beyond, and face a primal evil that threatens their lives and thousands more. </p> <p>The full list of narrators includes: Eric Pierpoint, Emily Adams, Stephen Mendel, Alexis Evans, Kerrie Keane, Jackson White, Terri Treas, Francesca Ling, Jackie Mah, Jeff Marcus, Kenneth Johnson, Nelson Estevez, and Susan Appling. </p>";
