window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From Heather Webber, </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author of</b><b><i> In the Middle of Hickory Lane,</i></b><b> comes this enchanting audiobook.</b></p> <p>A mysterious letter. An offer taken. And the chance to move forward.</p> <p>When Ava Harrison receives a letter containing an unusual job listing one month after the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend, she thinks she’s being haunted. The listing—a job as a live-in caretaker for a peculiar old man and his cranky cat in Driftwood, Alabama—is the perfect chance to start a new life. A <i>normal</i> life. Ava has always been too fearful to even travel, so no one’s more surprised than she is when she throws caution to the wind and drives to the distant beachside town.</p> <p>On the surface, Maggie Mae Brightwell is a bundle of energy as she runs Magpie’s, Driftwood’s coffee and curiosity shop, where there’s magic to be found in pairing the old with the new. But lurking under her cheerful exterior is a painful truth—keeping busy is the best way to distract herself from the lingering loss of her mama and her worries about her aging father. No one knows better than she does that you can’t pour from an empty cup, but holding on to the past is the only thing keeping the hope alive that her mama will return home one day.</p> <p>Ava and Maggie soon find they’re kindred spirits, as they’re both haunted—not by spirits, but by regret. They must learn to let go of the past to move on—because sometimes the waves of change bring you to the place where you most belong.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Forge Books.</b></p>";
