window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Explore the origin stories of Isabella Rodrigues and Benjamin Rogers long before they meet Charlotte Omandi or the<i> TSS Bladerunner.</i></p> <p>Isabella Rodrigues has been blessed with an abundance of charm and perseverance. She needed both to convince her fellow Georgia Institute of Technology students that storming Area 51 was a good idea.</p> <p>Isabella and her four college classmates have crossed the country to take part in a secret, live action role play contest scheduled to take place on the same day millions of people from social media have promised to raid the secret governmental facility housed deep beneath Nellis Air Force Base.</p> <p>Each of Isabella’s motley crew have different reasons for joining her campaign, ranging from romance to renumeration. However for Isabella, it will turn out to be a matter of life or death.<br> <br> What secrets are housed deep within the Air Force's most clandestine facility? The only way to find out is to join...<i>Isabella's Campaign.</i></p> <p>Author's comment: <i>Isabella's Campaign</i> is a complete story, but not a full-length novel. It serves as a light-hearted mini-prequel to <i>Paradigm 2045: Trinity's Children,</i> but both titles are standalone. It was originally published as part of the <i>Storming Area 51</i> anthology by Bayonet Books.</p>";
