window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s international bestseller </b><b><i>Let the Right One In</i></b><b> is “a brilliant take on the vampire myth, and a roaring good story” (</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Kelley Armstrong), the basis for the multi-film festival award-winning Swedish film, the U.S. adaptation </b><b><i>Let Me In</i></b><b> directed by Matt Reeves (</b><b><i>The Batman</i></b><b>), and the Showtime TV series.</b> </p> <p>It is autumn 1981 when inconceivable horror comes to Blackeberg, a suburb in Sweden. The body of a teenager is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at long last—revenge for the bullying he endures at school, day after day.</p> <p>But the murder is not the most important thing on his mind. A new girl has moved in next door—a girl who has never seen a Rubik’s Cube before, but who can solve it at once. There is something wrong with her, though, something odd. And she only comes out at night. . .</p>";
