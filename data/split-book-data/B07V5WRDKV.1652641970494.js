window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Trapped in the game. Forced back to level 1. What's next, permadeath? </b></p> <p>Sky Realms Online is the largest and most popular Virtual Reality MMORPG ever made. Set amongst the mystical, floating islands of Hankarth, it's played and enjoyed by millions every hour.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until something goes wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unable to log out, players find themselves reduced to level one, and in the starting zones. They receive a cryptic message from the developers stating that for unknown reasons, they are trapped in the game and may have to live out their lives within the virtual world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hall is one of the those trapped in the game. He’s been playing Sky Realms Online as a spear-wielding Skirmisher ever since the beta. And instead of panicking as many do, he decides to make the most of it; to play the game and live his new life, all while quietly hoping the developers will find a fix.&nbsp;</p> <p>It doesn’t take Hall long to find out that, while some aspects of the game are the same, the difficulty level is beyond anything he's ever experienced.&nbsp;</p> <p>Together, with a new party of trapped players and NPCs with canned answers, Hall will find out just how different Sky Realms Online has become, and how playing a game is different from living the game....</p> <p><b>Experience the start of this unforgettable LitRPG Adventure today! It's perfect for fans of J.A. Hunter, Dakota Krout, and Edward Brody. </b></p> <p><i>Performed by Pavi Proczko, narrator of </i>Eden's Gate<i> and </i>Continue Online<i>.</i></p>";
