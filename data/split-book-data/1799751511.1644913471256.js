Trained as an off-the-books government assassin and spoken about only in whispers, Evan Smoak was one of the most talented - and most feared - men in the Program.

His cousin has been brutally murdered, leaving Max an envelope that contains nothing but a mysterious key. However, someone really wants that key, badly enough that Max - and anyone he turns to - is in deadly danger. What seems like a simple job for The Nowhere Man turns out to be anything but. Behind every threat he takes out, a deadlier one emerges and Evan Smoak must put himself in greater danger than ever before as he heads once more <i>Into The Fire</i>.</p>";
