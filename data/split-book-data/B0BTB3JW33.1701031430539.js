You may hire my services for a small fee, that is a small portion of your divinity.</p> <p>I will send my minions to terrorize the populace and give people a reason to pray to you. I will spawn horrors to drum up support or even trigger a holy crusade.</p> <p>Just sign the contract and I’ll take care of everything. You won’t even have to lift a finger, except maybe to bless a few heroes of your choosing to face off against my armies and eventually defeat me, the dreaded Demon Lord, in dramatic fashion.</p> <p>This is a bargain you can’t possible pass up! But I warn you, if I hold up my end of the deal, I expect you to honor it too, or else…</p>";
