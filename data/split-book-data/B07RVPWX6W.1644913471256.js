Cause of death - a mystery. The lone survivor - a man, raving like a lunatic, wearing only a deerstalker hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, the man who calls himself Sherman Holmes is being studied like a lab rat by a top-secret government agency. How is it he can be barely clinging to reality one minute - yet be a seeming genius the next?

Now saddled with moving Sherman to a more-secure facility, he must prove he’s still up to the task. With enemies on their heels, a whole country to cross, and Sherman ranting in his ear, the job proves to be more of a challenge than Watson ever anticipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With Watson’s experience and the bizarre insights of his own twisted mind, Sherman just might survive.
