window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The new world is calling....</i></p> <p>Niell Torvald is desperate to prove himself - his father’s kingdom depends on him. When a vicious attack on the way to the Draconis Order monastery nearly kills him, it becomes clear that grave trials await him on this path. Joreth, the wise monk who saves his life, advises caution upon entering the sacred halls. His mission is to learn arcane magic from the monks that will help to cement his father’s power, but Niell will need more than magical arts alone to navigate the challenges before him.</p> <p>Among the monks’ students, Niell meets the lovely and mysterious Char, who senses evil deep within the ranks of the dragon order’s members. She takes him to a dragon she has raised, Paxala, and the three of them become fast friends. Niell soon grows in strength as he and his fellow students gain ancient knowledge, and his closeness to Char blossoms into something more.</p> <p>When Niell’s brothers grow impatient and attack the monastery in a bid to seize power, he will have to decide where his loyalties lie: with his warlord father’s domain or the new friends he has made in the wider world.</p>";
