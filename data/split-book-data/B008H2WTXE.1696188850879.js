There’s no chance left. No hope. Just six precious months until impact.</p> <p>The economy spirals downward while crops rot in the fields. Churches and synagogues are packed. People all over the world are walking off the job—but not Hank Palace. He’s investigating a death by hanging in a city that sees a dozen suicides every week—except this one feels suspicious, and Palace is the only cop who cares.</p> <p>The first in a trilogy, <i>The Last Policeman</i> offers a mystery set on the brink of an apocalypse. As Palace’s investigation plays out under the shadow of 2011GV1, we’re confronted by hard questions way beyond “whodunit.” <i>What basis does civilization rest upon? What is life worth? What would any of us do, what would we really do, if our days were numbered?</i></p>";
