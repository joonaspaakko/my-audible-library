window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Orson Reid: college freshman, gamer, and quite possibly the legendary boogeyman of the magical world. And you thought your life was weird.&nbsp;</p> <p>It all started the night Orson kissed his best friend, Elyse, and she kissed him back. Yes, the kiss was life-changing, but in ways Orson never could have imagined. It seems he contracted a \"virus\" that is making him taller, faster, and stronger. But his life doesn't go completely off the rails until the night Elyse shows up at his house, strips out of her clothes, and shape-shifts into a giant cat - a panther, to be exact.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, instead of preparing for his freshman year of college, Orson is tossed head first into a world where shape-shifters, magic, and monsters are real. A world ruled by the secretive Paragon Society, a group that enforces magical law with brutal efficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p>And if all that wasn't enough for one guy to deal with, Orson may just be the Ollphiest, the legendary monster that even monsters fear.</p>";
