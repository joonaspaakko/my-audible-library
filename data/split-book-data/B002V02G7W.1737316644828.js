window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“</b><b><i>Hell House</i></b><b> is the scariest haunted house novel ever written. It looms over the rest the way the mountains loom over the foothills.” — Stephen King<br> <br> From the author of</b><b><i> I Am Legend</i></b><b> comes </b><b><i>Hell House</i></b><b>, the basis for the supernatural horror film starring Pamela Franklin, Roddy McDowall, Clive Revill.</b></p> <p>For over twenty years, Belasco House has stood empty. Regarded as the Mount Everest of haunted houses, its shadowed walls have witnessed scenes of unimaginable horror and depravity. All previous attempts to probe its mysteries have ended in murder, suicide, or insanity. But now, a new investigation has been launched, bringing four strangers to Belasco House in search of the ultimate secrets of life and death. A wealthy publisher, brooding over his impending death, has paid a physicist and two mediums to establish the facts of life after death once and for all. For one night, they will investigate the Belasco House and learn exactly why the townsfolk refer to it as the Hell House.</p> <p><i>Hell House</i>, which inspired the 1973 film <i>The Legend of Hell House</i>, is Matheson’s most frightening and shocking book and an acknowledged classic of the genre.</p>";
