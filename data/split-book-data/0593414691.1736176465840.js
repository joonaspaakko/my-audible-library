The royal family—the despotic emperor and his monstrous sons, the Three Terrors—hold the countryside in their choking grip. They bleed the land and oppress the citizens with the frightful powers they inherited from the god locked under their palace.<br> <br> But that god cannot be contained forever.<br> <br> With the aid of Jun, a guard broken by his guilt-stricken past, and Keema, an outcast fighting for his future, the god escapes from her royal captivity and flees from her own children, the triplet Terrors who would drag her back to her unholy prison. And so it is that she embarks with her young companions on a five-day pilgrimage in search of freedom—and a way to end the Moon Throne forever. The journey ahead will be more dangerous than any of them could have imagined.<br> <br> Both a sweeping adventure story and an intimate exploration of identity, legacy, and belonging, <i>The Spear Cuts Through Water</i> is an ambitious and profound saga that will transport and transform you—and is like nothing you’ve ever read before.</p>";
