window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Best-selling author&nbsp;Matthew Mather presents the first two books in the Nomad series, now available in a single audiobook collection.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Nomad </i></b></p> <p>When exoplanet researcher Dr. Ben Rollins is told by NASA that a massive object in space could end the world, his first instinct is to call his daughter and wife: something is coming, he tells them. We can’t see it, we don’t know what it is, but it’s there. They’re calling it Nomad, and it’s coming fast. The world erupts into chaos as the end approaches - and Ben discovers that his wife and daughter are trapped. The key to humanity’s survival may rest in the answers he pieces together, in the midst of his frantic scramble to find his family before Nomad swallows the planet.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Sanctuary </i></b></p> <p>In the Day of the Nomad, oceans flooded the continents and the earth split open, pouring darkness into the skies. Jessica Rollins survived, but at what cost? The key to humanity’s survival may lie in the backpack she recovered from her father, in data he collected more than 30 years before. Her father’s words circle around and around in her head. What does the data mean? Who is the mysterious Ufuk Erdogmus? And what is...Sanctuary?</p>";
