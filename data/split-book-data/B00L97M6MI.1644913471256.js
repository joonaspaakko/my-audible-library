window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Clive Barker has made his mark on modern fiction by exposing all that is surreal and magical in the ordinary world - and exploring the profound and overwhelming terror that results. With its volatile mix of the fantastical and the contemporary, the everyday and the otherworldly, <i>Weaveworld</i> is an epic work of dark fantasy and horror - a tour de force from one of today's most forceful and imaginative artists.</p>";
