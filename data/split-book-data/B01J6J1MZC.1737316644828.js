She dreams of making a name for herself and becoming the richest woman in the Empire. </p><p>But when she's roped into a murky investigation by a First Adjudicator to the immortal Emperor himself, her life is thrown into disarray. Will this be the perfect opportunity to showcase her skills and make valuable connections, or will her future now be in the hands of political powers that can never be denied? </p><p>Working against her will, and afraid of the consequences of refusing the commission, she uncovers evidence that points to an attempt on the Emperor's life. Felicienne rapidly finds herself a target and must use her considerable wits to uncover the plot of an unseen enemy who always seems to be one step ahead of the game. </p>";
