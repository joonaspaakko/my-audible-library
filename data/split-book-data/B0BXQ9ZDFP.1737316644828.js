window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Trouble is brewing in Nexus, and for some reason, they think I can stop it.</p> <p>Some people are born to greatness. My mother wanted to strangle me at birth. I've not had an easy life, not in a world that thrives on magic. Spells to reinforce buildings. Hexes to give you the face of a supermodel. Or so I've been told.</p> <p>No one can hide their true face from me, and people get ugly when they find out my presence is the reason magic shrivels and dies.</p> <p>It's not as cool as it sounds, so when I'm offered a job with the Special Monsters Unit, I take a chance and join a misfit crew to find out why the town of Nexus is a magnet for cryptids.</p> <p>At least I'm part of a team. I'm making friends. I'm—finding out secrets about my past that are hard to handle.</p> <p>But my emotional scars will have to wait until after we deal with the monsters. Especially those with human faces.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
