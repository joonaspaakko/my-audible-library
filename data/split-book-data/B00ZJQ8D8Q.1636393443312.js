The gripping story of a group of American scientists sent to the ocean floor to investigate an alien ship, only to confront a terrifying discovery that defies imagination, <i>Sphere</i> is Crichton prime - truly masterful fiction from the ingenious mind that brought us <i>Prey</i>,<i> State of Fear</i>, and <i>Jurassic Park</i>.</p> <p><i>Sphere</i> was made into a film directed by Barry Levinson, which starred Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson.</p>";
