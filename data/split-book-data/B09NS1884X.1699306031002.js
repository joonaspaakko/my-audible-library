That is, until she finds a spell book in the Vanderbilt archives that accidentally gives her access to a magical dimension.</p> <p>Now she's hunted by a magic-wielding terrorist group called the Kingdom, and the only way for her to survive is to team up with a secret branch of the CIA.

With these totems comes the power to control the world.</p> <p>But the spell book isn't the only thing with secrets in Jayne's new life. Danger lurks in every corner and Jayne must rise to meet her fated role...or perish alongside the rest of the world.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
