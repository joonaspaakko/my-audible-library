He's the one who convinces the local PD to ignore any tribal violence. The guy who makes sure the goblins aren't evicted whenever they do something decidedly goblin. </p> <p>He also does the little things that no one else is willing to do. Like handing keys over whenever a prodigal son returns, or identifying the body of said prodigal. </p> <p>Then there's the occasional murderous paladin and his vengeful god to deal with. </p> <p>All in a day's work. </p>";
