window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Agent Kit Morris. Has a nice ring, doesn't it? It's a big step up from \"wanted criminal\" or \"that weird con-artist guy with weirder psychic powers\", both of which recently applied to me. But my promotion to MagiPol agent comes with a few drawbacks.</p> <p>First, supremely talented and effortlessly gorgeous Agent Lienna Shen won't agree to a dinner date with me. Second, my new assignment has pitted me against a guild with very bad taste in pets. Third, those pets are demons, and those demons want to kill me.</p> <p>My psychic magic is great for conning people. It doesn't do jack shit against hellish orcs. If I screw this up, my dinner date will be with a demon - and I'll be the dinner. Even better, I kind of suspect this supposedly straightforward assignment is actually the tip of an unholy iceberg of power-hungry malefactors bent on destroying all law and order in the city.</p> <p>I should probably mention that last part to my boss.</p>";
