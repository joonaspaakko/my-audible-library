window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Original cast members from the beloved TV series, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, reunite for an all-new adventure about connections that never die—even if you bury them.</p> <p>A decade has passed since the epic final battle that concluded <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> (TV). The game-changing spell that gave power to all potential Slayers persists. With new Slayers constantly emerging, things are looking grim for the bad guys. Rebellious vampire Spike (James Marsters) is working undercover in Los Angeles with his old pal Clem (James Charles Leary) when he meets feisty, rookie Slayer, Indira (Laya DeLeon Hayes), who wants Spike to be her mentor. Stakes intensify as Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) emerges from an alternate reality where she alone is the Slayer, and Buffy Summers doesn’t exist. Cordelia enlists Spike’s help with a classic big bad terrorizing her world…his ex, Drusilla (Juliet Landau). Giles (Anthony Head), Anya (Emma Caulfield Ford), Jonathan (Danny Strong), and Tara (Amber Benson) also return, but through the years and the vastness of the multiverse, not everyone is who they used to be…</p> <p><i>Slayers: A Buffyverse Story</i> is written and directed by Amber Benson and Chris Golden, and co-directed by Kc Wayland.</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
