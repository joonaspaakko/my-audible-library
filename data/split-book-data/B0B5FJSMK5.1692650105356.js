window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Daniel’s 16th birthday is starting out like any other day: He’s late for school, his homework’s due, his crush doesn’t know he’s alive, and his afterschool gig is a joke. There’s just one more thing: He needs to save the human race from annihilation.</p> <p>James Patterson’s thrilling adventure series gets an exclusive, audio-only origin story in <i>Daniel X: Genesis</i>, brought to life by an all-star cast. We meet Daniel, an ordinary teen just trying to navigate his way through high school. That all changes when he discovers he has super powers and can conjure up anything, at any time, just by imagining it. Suddenly he’s meeting powerful entities who tell him he is not, in fact, a typical teenage human but an alien...and his parents died not in a car wreck but in an epic battle with an intergalactic villain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Can Daniel find the courage to take up the fight? Can he use his powers to save the Earth? And can he finally get to shred onstage in front of thousands of screaming fans? So much to do, so little time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Starring Michael Cimino (<i>Love, Victor</i>), Abigail Breslin (<i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>), Mercedes Ruehl (<i>The Fisher King</i>), Jimmi Simpson (<i>Westworld</i>), and a full cast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
