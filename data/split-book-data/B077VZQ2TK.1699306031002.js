It's your standard grey alien from innumerable abduction stories. It still sits at the controls of the spaceship it crash-landed 11 years ago. A secret military base was built around the crash site to study both Moss and the dangerous technology it brought to Earth.&nbsp;</p> <p>The day Matt Salem joins her security team, Dak's whole world changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's love at first sight - which is a problem, since they both signed ironclad contracts vowing not to fraternize with other military personnel. If they run, they'll be hunted for what they know. Dak and Matt have only way to be together: do the impossible. Steal Moss and sell the secret of its existence.&nbsp;</p> <p>And they can't afford a single mistake.&nbsp;</p> <p>This program is read by Ashlie Atkinson, Nat Cassidy, Hanna Cheek, Rebecca Comtois, Jorge Cordova, Sol Marina Crespo, Reyna de Courcy, Neimah Djourabchi, Autumn Dornfeld, Abe Goldfarb, Jason Howard, Daryl Lathon, Kelley Rae O'Donnell, Mac Rogers, Seth Sheldon, David Shih, Brian Silliman, Tarantino Smith, Jennifer Tsay, James Wetzel, Brittany Williams, Jordana Williams, Sean Williams, and Christopher Yustin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also available from Tor Books: <i>Steal the Stars</i>, a novel by Nat Cassidy, the official adaptation of the podcast and an NPR Book of the Year&nbsp;</p>";
