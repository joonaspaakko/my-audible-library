Harder to say when this new talent arrived. But Lion Zorn is the first of his kind—an empathy tracker, an emotional soothsayer, with a felt sense for the future of the we. In simpler terms, he can spot cultural shifts and trends before they happen.<br> <br> It’s a useful skill for a certain kind of company.<br> <br> Arctic Pharmaceuticals is that kind of company. But when a routine em-tracking job leads to the discovery of a gruesome murder, Lion finds himself neck-deep in a world of eco-assassins, soul hackers and consciousness terrorists. But what the man really needs is a nap.<br> <br> A unique blend of cutting-edge technology and traditional cyberpunk, <i>Last Tango in Cyberspace </i>explores hot topics like psychology, neuroscience, technology, as well as ecological and animal rights issues. The world created in <i>Last Tango</i> is based very closely on our world about five years from now, and all technology in the story either exists in labs or is rumored to exist.
