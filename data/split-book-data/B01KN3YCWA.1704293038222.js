window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The ghost of Sherlock Holmes is dead, but who will solve his murder? </p><p>The Great Detective's ghost has walked London's streets for an age, given shape by people's memories. Now someone's put a ceremonial dagger through his chest. But what's the motive? And who - or what - could kill a ghost? </p><p>When policing London's supernatural underworld, eliminating the impossible is not an option. DI James Quill and his detectives have learnt this the hard way. Gifted with the Sight, they'll pursue a criminal genius - who'll lure them into a Sherlockian maze of clues and evidence. The team also have their own demons to fight. They've been to hell and back (literally), but now the unit is falling apart.... </p>";
