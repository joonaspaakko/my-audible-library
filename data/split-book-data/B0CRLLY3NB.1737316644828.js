All is well in their queer utopia.</p> <p>Or is it?</p> <p>Investigative reporter Sarah Keebler (Sarah Steele) is piecing together the crew's previous heist for her bombshell true-crime podcast–and getting dangerously close to the truth. CLITO dispatches their finest agents to stop Keebler's investigation at any cost, but do they have what it takes to finish the job? And why is she so invested in this story, anyway? And what does all this have to do with a notoriously bloodthirsty, litigious right-wing gay billionaire?</p> <p>Judy and his friends are about to learn the hard way that in the high-stakes world of scandalous crime, what goes around comes around.</p> <p>Starring Bowen Yang and an all-star queer cast including Shannon Woodward, Jane Lynch, Cynthia Nixon, Ian McKellen, Jesse James Keitel, and Raúl Esparza, <i>Hot White Heist 2</i> has twice the action, two times the drama, and double the double entendres.</p>";
