window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Beyond the Pale</i> is an anthology of 12 dark fantasy and paranormal stories that skirt the border between our world and others. Was that my imagination, or did I hear something under my bed? What was that blurred movement in my darkened closet?

Later, it acquired the figurative meaning of an enclosed, and therefore, safe domain. Conversely, \"beyond the pale\" means foreign, strange, or threatening.
