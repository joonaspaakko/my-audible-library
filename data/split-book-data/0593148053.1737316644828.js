window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As a magical revolution remakes a city, an ancient evil is awakened in a brilliant novel from the Hugo-nominated author of </b><b><i>Foundryside </i></b><b>and the Divine Cities trilogy.</b></p> <p><b>“An absolutely wild ride...</b><b><i>Foundryside</i></b><b> blew me away, and this is a perfect sequel.” (Amal El-Mohtar, </b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>A few years ago, Sancia Grado would’ve happily watched Tevanne burn. Now, she’s hoping to transform her city into something new. Something better. Together with allies Orso, Gregor, and Berenice, she’s about to strike a deadly blow against Tevanne’s cruel robber-baron rulers and wrest power from their hands for the first time in decades.</p> <p>But then comes a terrifying warning: Crasedes Magnus himself, the first of the legendary hierophants, is about to be reborn. And if he returns, Tevanne will be just the first place to feel his wrath.</p> <p>Thousands of years ago, Crasedes was an ordinary man who did the impossible: Using the magic of scriving - the art of imbuing objects with sentience - he convinced reality that he was something more than human. Wielding powers beyond comprehension, he strode the world like a god for centuries, meting out justice and razing empires single-handedly, cleansing the world through fire and destruction - and even defeating death itself.</p> <p>Like it or not, it’s up to Sancia to stop him. But to have a chance in the battle to come, she’ll have to call upon a god of her own - and unlock the door to a scriving technology that could change what it means to be human. And no matter who wins, nothing will ever be the same.</p> <p>The awe-inspiring second installment of the Founders Trilogy, <i>Shorefall</i> returns us to the world Robert Jackson Bennett created in his acclaimed <i>Foundryside</i>...and forges it anew.</p>";
