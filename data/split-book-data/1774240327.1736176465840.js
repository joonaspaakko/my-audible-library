To Erin Solstice, an inn seems like a medieval relic from the past. But here she is, running from Goblins and trying to survive in a world full of monsters and magic. She'd be more excited about all of this if everything wasn't trying to kill her. But an inn is what she's found, and so that's what she becomes; an innkeeper, who serves drinks to heroes and monsters.</p> <p>Actually, mostly monsters. But it's a living, right?</p>";
