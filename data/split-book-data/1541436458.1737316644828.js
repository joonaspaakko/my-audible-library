No one....</p> <p>You have been offered a quest by the Biscuit's Union: Rebuild the Guild </p> <p>Reform the guild by having at least eight members in good standing by the end of one week. </p> <p>Reward for success: survival of the guild, unknown, XP </p> <p>Penalty for failure (or refusal): the death of the guild </p> <p>Okay then. So in order for any of the work Clyde's put in to matter, for any of the numerous deaths he's gone through to count, he has to keep the guild going and remain its leader. Which means he's got a busy week ahead of him. Seven Days. Eight Guild Members. Countless Problems.</p>";
