Unfortunately being dead doesn't make Harry's life any easier. </p> <p>Trapped between life and death, he learns that his friends are in serious trouble. Only by finding his murderer can he save his friends and move on - a feat that would be a lot easier if he had a body and access to his powers. Worse still are the malevolent shadows that roam Chicago, controlled by a dark entity that wants Harry to suffer even in death. </p> <p>Now the late Harry Dresden will have to pull off the ultimate trick without using any magic - or face an eternity as just another lost soul....</p>";
