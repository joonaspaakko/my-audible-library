window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The English-language debut of the best-selling Dutch novel, <i>Hex</i>, from Thomas Olde Heuvelt - a Hugo and World Fantasy Award-nominated talent to watch </p> <p>Whoever is born here is doomed to stay 'til death. Whoever settles never leaves. </p> <p>Welcome to Black Spring, the seemingly picturesque Hudson Valley town haunted by the Black Rock Witch, a 17th-century woman whose eyes and mouth are sewn shut. Muzzled, she walks the streets and enters homes at will. She stands next to children's beds for nights on end. Everybody knows that her eyes may never be opened, or the consequences will be too terrible to bear. </p> <p>The elders of Black Spring have virtually quarantined the town by using high-tech surveillance to prevent their curse from spreading. Frustrated with being kept in lockdown, the town's teenagers decide to break their strict regulations and go viral with the haunting. But, in so doing, they send the town spiraling into dark, medieval practices of the distant past. </p> <p>This chilling audiobook heralds the arrival of an exciting new voice in mainstream horror and dark fantasy. </p>";
