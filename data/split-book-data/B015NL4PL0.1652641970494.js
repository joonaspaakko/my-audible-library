window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jordan helps kids on the run find their way back home. He's good at that. He should be - he's a runaway himself. Sometimes he helps the kids in other stranger ways. He looks like a regular teenager, but he's not. He acts like he's not exactly human, but he is. He treads the line between mundane reality and the world of the supernatural. </p><p>Desdaemona also knows the nonhuman world far too well. She tracks Jordan down and enlists his aid in searching for her lost sister, Fay, who did a Very Bad Thing involving an immortal. This may be a mistake - for both of them. Too many people are interested now, and some of them are not people at all. </p><p>Ben Macallan's urban fantasy debut takes you on a terrifying journey, lifting the curtain on what really walks our city streets. </p>";
