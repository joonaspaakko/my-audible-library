window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This collected edition of the Antarktos Saga includes all five books in the series - <i>Descent</i>, <i>Pursuit</i>, <i>Ascent</i>, <i>Lament</i>, and <i>Onslaught</i>. More than 35 hours of pulse-pounding audio written by the <i>New York Times</i> and number one Audible best-selling author Jeremy Robinson and narrated by the best-selling and award-winning narrator R.C. Bray.</p> <p>Description:</p> <p>Iâ€™ve been told that the entire continent of Antarctica groaned at the moment of my birth. The howl tore across glaciers, over mountains, and deep into the ice. Everyone says so. Except for my father; all he heard was Mother's sobs. Not of pain, but of joy, so he says. Other than that, the only verifiable fact about the day I was born is that an iceberg the size of Los Angeles broke free from the ice shelf, a few miles off the coast. Again, some would have me believe the fracture took place as I entered the world. But all that really matters, according to my parents, is that I, Solomon Ull Vincent, the first child born on Antarctica - the first and only Antarctican - was born on September 2, 1974.</p> <p>If only someone could have warned me that upon my return to the continent of my birth, 13 years later, I would be kidnapped, subjected to tortures beyond comprehension, and forced to fight...and kill. If only someone had hinted that I'd wind up struggling to survive in a subterranean world full of ancient warriors, strange creatures, and supernatural powers.</p> <p>Had I been warned, I might have lived a normal life. The human race might have remained safe. And the fate of the world might not rest on my shoulders. Had I been warned....</p> <p>This is my story - the tale of Solomon Ull Vincent - the last hunter.</p>";
