window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The thunderous conclusion to the award-winning fantasy epic... </p><p>Following Stronghold's destruction, Rukh and Jessira lead the ragged remnants of the OutCastes on the long march to Ashoka. There they seek sanctuary for her people, but in order to do so they must overcome unyielding law that demands exile for all ghrinas. Meanwhile, Hal'El Wrestiva - exposed and reviled as the Withering Knife murderer - escapes from Ashoka and hatches one final scheme to resuscitate his soiled reputation. The Virtuous, a newly formed organization full of certitude and strife, plots the destruction of House Shektan. And Li-Choke and the Baels launch a final desperate plan to save their kind as well as all of Humanity. But it is Rukh who must confront the harshest of choices. It is one that will cost him everything he loves but might also see to the salvation of his home. He cannot falter, for Suwraith has once again turned her ruinous intentions toward Ashoka. </p>";
