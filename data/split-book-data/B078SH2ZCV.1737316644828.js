Most ignore the warning signs. Alex Fletcher, Iraq War veteran, has read the signs for years. With his family and home prepared to endure an extended period of seclusion, Alex thinks he's ready for the pandemic. He's not even close.The unstoppable H16N1 virus will be the least of his problems. </p> <p><i>The Perseid Collapse </i>(Book 2)<br> </p> <p>On August 19, 2019, an inconceivable attack against America's infrastructure will unleash a human darkness over the United States - with a vast appetite for chaos and violence. Alex Fletcher, former Marine, will wake to this brutally hostile landscape, thrown headfirst into an epic, impossibly grueling journey to save his family and friends. </p> <p><i>Event Horizon</i> (Book 3) <br> </p> <p>With Boston collapsing faster than Alex Fletcher predicted, his personal rescue mission deep into the heart of an increasingly unfamiliar city reaches a critical point. Pursued by a ruthless militia group and forced to navigate a treacherous landscape, he runs a gauntlet of grim decisions and impossible odds to reach perceived safety. Perceived, because nothing is safe in the world emerging after the \"event\". </p> <p><i>Point of Crisis</i> (Book 4) <br> </p> <p>In the aftermath of the brutal attack on his family compound, Alex Fletcher embraces his rapidly expanding role within the New England Regional Recovery Zone (RRZ). Fueled by a limitless drive to protect his family and a rekindled sense of duty, he enlists the reluctant aid of a local militia commander. As Captain Fletcher digs deeper into the government's plans, he starts to question the federal government's intentions - and ability to stabilize the situation in New England. </p> <p><i>Dispatches </i>(Book 5) <br> </p> <p>With the United States crippled, belligerent powers rise to fill the void overseas, catapulting already volatile regions into chaos and war - hastening a worldwide collapse. As spring arrives, Alex Fletcher faces a difficult choice. With their food supplies running low, Alex questions the feasibility of staying with the Thorntons and Walkers at their isolated lake community. </p>";
