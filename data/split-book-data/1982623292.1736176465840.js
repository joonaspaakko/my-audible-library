With an army behind him, he marches along the Skull Road, ready to lay waste to the lands in the west. The rag-tag defenders of Dunrun are all that stand in his way. With their country besieged on all sides, troubling rumors of a priestess amassing power in the North, and unnatural alliances to the south, no help is coming. Alone, they must hold back the god-like powers of the Iron Tusk, or see life as they know it come to an end.</p>";
