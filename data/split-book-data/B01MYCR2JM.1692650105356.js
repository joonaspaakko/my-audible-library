window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I watched in horror as dark magic sprang from my hand faster than an imp after your socks. I didn't know my name, let alone that I had such power. The man was dead. I panicked. I ran. How was I to know I was a dark magic enforcer, tasked with keeping magic hidden from the world? Yeah, total noob move, I know. But my memory is returning, and the Hidden have given me 24 hours to make amends. Cover it up. Finish the job I was given, or else. Failure isn't an option. Well, it is, but I like me, and I like being alive. The clock is ticking as I battle to make things right and exact revenge on those who took so much from me. Easier said than done as I deal with angry mages, bitey zombies, oversexed imps, creepy necromancers, and grumpy trolls - and those are just my friends - all while trying to stop myself falling in love with my best friend, Kate, who just so happens to be a hot vampire. I'm Faz Pound, a.k.a. Black Spark, Dark Magic Enforcer, and time is running out. At least I have my looks. For now. </p>";
