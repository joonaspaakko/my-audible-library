But just as he’s about to take one final breath, a snarky alien parasite offers him a deal: His life in return for sharing his body.</p> <p>With a little coaxing from his new pop-culture-loving inner resident, AJ’s broken carcass improves so much that even an old flame is impressed. But his bright outlook fizzles when he discovers he's at ground zero of a galactic conspiracy to strip Earth of precious resources humans don't even know exist.</p> <p>Can the unlikely partners join forces and use AJ's rusty military skills to raise the alarm?
