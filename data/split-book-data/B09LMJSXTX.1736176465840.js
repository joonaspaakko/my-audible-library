They were wrong.</p> <p>As the son of a mere merchant, Klöss wants nothing more than to pass his trials and join the ranks of the Bjornmen raiders, breaking free of his father’s ambitions and following in the footsteps of his forebears. Times are changing in the Barren Isles. The centuries-old traditions of coastal plunder are making way for outright conquest, and the threat of war is looming.</p> <p>Found abandoned in the forests of Anlan, Devin wants nothing more than a simple life.
