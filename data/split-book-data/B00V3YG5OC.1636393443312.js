So when two vampires try to kidnap the baby, it quickly turns into a fight to the death - Lex’s death, that is.</p> <p>She wakes up to two shocking discoveries: she has miraculously survived the fight, and baby Charlie is a “null”, gifted with the ability to weaken supernatural forces...and a target for creatures who want to control that power. Determined to guarantee her niece’s safety, Lex makes a deal with the local vampires. She sets out with the mysterious - and undead - “fixer” Quinn to track down whoever’s responsible for the kidnapping, sharpening her newfound magic skills along the way. But the closer she gets to the truth, the more dangerous her powers become.</p> <p><i>Boundary Crossed</i> is a dark, thrilling journey into a world where the line between living and dead isn’t nearly as solid as it appears...</p>";
