window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A warrior with a secret. A band of cutthroats. And a monster of legend.</p> <p>It is a time of war. After years of relentless and pitiless battles, the tired country of Sunja realizes its spine is close to breaking. Desperate for aid, the king dispatches a company of soldiers to the north in a desperate plea for help from its neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Sunjan cavalier called Bloor has the unenviable task of protecting a mysterious and heavily armored koch destined for the northern kingdom. Under his command is a mixed force of heavy infantry, horsemen, and the king’s own hand-picked guard, all entrusted with escorting the koch and ensuring its safety. Not only does Bloor have to be ever watchful of their enemy’s movements, he must maintain order among the men under his command - and temper their obvious dislike for each other.&nbsp;</p> <p>And Bloor must contend with a rival cavalier, a man bitter and resentful over not being chosen to command the mission.</p> <p>Despite the tension throughout the ranks, orders are orders.&nbsp;</p> <p>Take the koch to the north. Protect it at all costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The doomed and divided company will soon discover it’s not the war-torn northern wilderness they will have to be on guard against, or the legions of hated Nordish soldiers who seek to capture the koch and its true contents.&nbsp;</p> <p>A much more sinister threat awaits Bloor and his soldiers, just out of sight of Sunja’s high walls, one that will rip Bloor and his command apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>A story of heroic fantasy. Some graphic violence and language.</p>";
