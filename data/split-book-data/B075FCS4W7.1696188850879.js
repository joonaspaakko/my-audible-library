window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this thrilling and suspenseful fantasy set in the world of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Others series, an inn owner and her shape-shifting lodger find themselves enmeshed in danger and dark secrets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Human laws do not apply in the territory controlled by the Others--vampires, shape-shifters, and even deadlier paranormal beings. And this is a fact that humans should never, ever forget....&nbsp;</p> <p>After her divorce, Vicki DeVine took over a rustic resort near Lake Silence, in a human town that is not human controlled. Towns such as Vicki's don't have any distance from the Others, the dominant predators who rule most of the land and all of the water throughout the world. And when a place has no boundaries, you never really know what is out there watching you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Vicki was hoping to find a new career and a new life. But when her lodger, Aggie Crowe--one of the shape-shifting Others--discovers a murdered man, Vicki finds trouble instead. The detectives want to pin the death on her, despite the evidence that nothing human could have killed the victim. As Vicki and her friends search for answers, ancient forces are roused by the disturbance in their domain. They have rules that must not be broken--and all the destructive powers of nature at their command.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
