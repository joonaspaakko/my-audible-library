window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Valentine Michael Smith, an earthling born and educated on Mars, arrives on Earth with superhuman powers and a total ignorance of the mores of man. On his new planet, Smith is destined to become a freak, a media commodity, a scam artist, a searcher, a sexual pioneer, a neon evangelist, a martyr, and, finally, a messiah. <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> is the most famous science fiction novel ever written. It became the bible of the \"love generation\" and transcended the genre to achieve the status of a modern classic.</p>";
