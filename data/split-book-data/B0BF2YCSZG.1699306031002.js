How far will Brent go to “become” the character?</p> <p>Starring Zachary Quinto (<i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Heroes</i>), Stephanie Beatriz (<i>Encanto</i>, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>), Lil Rel Howery (<i>Get Out</i>), and a full cast, <i>The Method</i> is pure James Patterson—a roller-coaster ride of lies, coverups, and dark deeds.</p>";
