He is, after all, a monster himself. </p> <p>Cursed in his errant past, his body now harbors an infernal fiend of pure elemental chaos. Yet none are more suited to investigate those sinister deeds of criminal sorcery than the city’s greatest detective magus. </p> <p>Aided by his loyal apprentice and the science of forensic alchemy, Aldicus must unravel a deadly string of sorcerous crimes menacing the Clockwork City. But in the decaying depths of the Underworks far below, there festers an even greater evil—a darkness rising to consume not only Corradon, but to ravage their entire world.</p> <p><i>The Case Files of Aldicus Vescard</i> recounts a series of interconnected investigations, leading the way to a diabolical mystery more terrible than any Aldicus has faced before.</p>";
