window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>‘Twas a time when dragons left their lair and evil shadowed the land....</i></p> <p>On the Day of Reckoning, the witches of Eileanan were outlawed - and violations of the new order were punishable by death. Eileanan’s Great Towers, once meccas of magic and learning, were left in ruins. And now, the entire land trembles in fear.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet deep in the mountains, in the shadow of Dragonclaw, a young girl is being tutored in the old ways. Ignorant of her past, uncertain of her future, the foundling Isabeau will soon be forced down a dangerous path of prophecy, conspiracy, and magic. It is a world where dragons possess the key to ancient mysteries, where a lost prince will discover a strange and wondrous destiny, and where the ultimate battle between good and evil will be waged.&nbsp;</p> <p>A new Day of Reckoning is at hand....</p>";
