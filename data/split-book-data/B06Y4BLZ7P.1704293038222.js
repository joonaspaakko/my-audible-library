Imagine an unholy cabal of the world's richest and most powerful men directing this sinister plan in order to cement their unbridled control of the planet. </p> <p>Imagine two heroes emerging from that darkness to do battle with the forces of evil. </p> <p>Set in the mean streets of Chicago, <i>Talon of God</i> is the action-packed adventure centered around Lauryn Jefferson, a beautiful young doctor who is dragged into a seemingly impossible battle against the invisible forces of Satan's army and their human agents that are bent on enslaving humanity in a mission to establish the kingdom of hell on Earth. </p> <p>But Lauryn is a skeptic, and it's only as she sees a diabolical drug sweep her city and begins to train in the ways of a spirit warrior with the legendary man of God Talon Hunter that she discovers her true nature and inner strength. Facing dangerous trials and tests, it's a true baptism by fire. And if they fail, millions could die. And rivers of blood would flow throughout the land. </p> <p>Imagine such horror. Such pain. And imagine what it would take to fight against it. For only the strongest and most faithful will survive. </p> <p>Get ready. Armageddon approaches quickly. </p>";
