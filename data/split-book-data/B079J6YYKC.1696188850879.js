If only the nightmare had ended when she was rescued. Instead, her real father exploited her tabloid-ready story for fame and profit - until Charlotte finally broke free from her ghoulish past and fled. Just when she thinks she has buried her personal hell forever, Charlotte is swept into a frightening new ordeal. Secretly dosed with an experimental drug, she’s endowed with a shocking new power - but pursued by a treacherous corporation desperate to control her.</p> <p>Except from now on, if anybody is going to control Charlotte, it’s going to be Charlotte herself. She’s determined to use the extraordinary ability she now possesses to fight the kind of evil that shattered her life - by drawing a serial killer out from the shadows to face the righteous fury of a victim turned avenger.</p>";
