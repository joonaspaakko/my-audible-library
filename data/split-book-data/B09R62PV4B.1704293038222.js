window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the 2023 Audie Award for Best Male Narrator</b></p> <p><b>A #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Bestseller and </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review </i></b><b>Editors’ Choice! </b></p> <p><b>Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it.</p> <p>Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Magnificent, terrifying, and “spellbinding…packed with glorious flights of imagination and characteristic tenderness about childhood, <i>Fairy Tale</i> is vintage King at his finest” (<i>Esquire</i>).</p> <p>“Good, evil, a kingdom to save, monsters to slay—these are the stuff that page-turners are made from.”—Laura Miller, <i>Slate</i></p>";
