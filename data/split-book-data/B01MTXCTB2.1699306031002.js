window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For fans of <i>The Hero's Guide to Saving Your Kingdom</i> comes an offbeat, comedic spin on the Excalibur legend told from the point of view of a talking dog who wants to be a magician! </b></p> <p>Meet Nosewise. He's spunky. He's curious. And he's a dog who can't understand why his packmates Merlin and Morgana spend all day practicing magic tricks. If it's a trick they want, he's the dog to ask! He can already Sit!, Stay!, and Roll Over! </p> <p>But there's no way Nosewise is Stay!ing when his master and best friend, Merlin, is kidnapped. There's nothing Nosewise won't do to get Merlin back, even if it means facing the strange Fae people and their magic-eating worms or tangling with the mysterious Sword in the Stone. But it may take more than sniffing out a spell to do it! </p> <p>Nosewise's hilarious escapades and steadfast loyalty get him and his companions through King Arthur's Dark Ages. </p>";
