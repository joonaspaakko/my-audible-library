window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Raised from birth to be a force for justice, Damian Stockwell has spent his entire life honing his body, mind, and fists to combat the evils of the world. He travels the globe on a quest to confront those evils and punch them in the face. At his disposal are a vast fortune, an endless array of gadgets and an army of friends including Bertrand, his loyal and lethal valet.</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Triple-Barreled Edition includes three of Damian Stockwell's most harrowing adventures:</p> <p><b><i>Horror in Honduras</i></b><b> (Book 1)</b></p> <p>Stockwell’s friend has gone missing in a Central American jungle and the only clue left behind is the grotesque image of a demonic tribal mask. The mystery will take Damian from the concrete jungles of New York City to the untamed wilds of Honduras - with a brief altercation in the armpit of Lady Liberty - as he races to the rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Join Dam and his trusted valet, Bertrand, as they rush headlong into danger and go face-to-face with evil incarnate to save their missing friend from the Horror in Honduras.</p> <p><b><i>Terrors of Tesla</i></b><b> (Book 2)</b></p> <p>On the eve of World War II, Damian Stockwell’s old friend, Nikola Tesla, delivers grave news. The plans to his greatest weapons have been stolen and the forces of evil intend to use them against America. His patriotism inflamed, Stockwell begins the hunt for the missing plans. The fight will pit him against two evil empires as he goes up against homegrown Nazis and mystical Ninjas that seek to conquer the world.</p> <p><b><i>The Mechanical Menace</i></b><b> (Book 3)</b></p> <p>On the eve of tomorrow, Damian’s own invention has run amuck causing terror at the 1933 World’s Fair. To discover who is behind the malevolent mishap, Dam must travel from the dangerous streets of New York to the political hotbed of London and on to a deceptively picturesque perfumery in France. Sinister forces are at work and Stockwell soon finds himself facing off against unseen enemies and evil robots as he and his loyal valet, Bertrand, races against time to stop The Mechanical Menace.&nbsp;</p>";
