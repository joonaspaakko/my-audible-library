Or at least laughs. What a hoot!\" (Terry Brooks)</b></p> <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, a hero, the Chosen One, was born...and so begins every fairy tale ever told. This is not that fairy tale. There is a Chosen One, but he is unlike any One who has ever been Chosened. And there is a faraway kingdom, but you have never been to a magical world quite like the land of Pell. There, a plucky farm boy will find more than he's bargained for on his quest to awaken the sleeping princess in her cursed tower.&nbsp;</p> <p>First there's the Dark Lord, who wishes for the boy's untimely death...and also very fine cheese. Then there's a bard without a song in her heart but with a very adorable and fuzzy tail, an assassin who fears not the night but is terrified of chickens, and a mighty fighter more frightened of her sword than of her chain-mail bikini. This journey will lead to sinister umlauts, a trash-talking goat, the Dread Necromancer Steve, and a strange and wondrous journey to the most peculiar \"happily ever after\" that ever once-upon-a-timed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Praise for <i>Kill the Farm Boy</i>:</p> <p>\"A rollicking fantasy adventure that upends numerous genre tropes in audacious style...a laugh-out-loud-funny fusion of Monty Python-esque humor and whimsy a la Terry Pratchett's Discworld.\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p> <p>“Dawson and Hearne’s reimagining of a traditional fairy tale is reminiscent of William Goldman’s <i>The Princess Bride</i> and William Steig’s <i>Shrek</i>!
