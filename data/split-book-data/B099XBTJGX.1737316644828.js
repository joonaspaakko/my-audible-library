That night, after picking up his wife, Bree, from her shift at a local casino, he breaks the bad news.</p> <p>Moments later, thunder cracks the sky, but there’s no lightning. Flaming debris rain across the valley, and a dark mass goes sailing out of the clouds, headed straight for LA.</p> <p>It’s not one of the Union’s starships, because they can’t defy gravity like that. But then, what is it?</p> <p>The answer chills both Chris and Bree to their cores: It’s an invasion.</p> <p>They have to pick up their kids and get away from the city. But the Randalls soon discover that nowhere is far enough away to keep them safe. </p>";
