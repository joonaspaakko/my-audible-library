Naturally, his creation faces a harsh world bent on using it, exploiting it, or destroying it. If the first synthetic intelligence is to survive its early years, it'll need friends, but more importantly, it'll need a family.</p> <p>And together, they'll need to show their enemies they're worth saving...or fearing.</p> <p>Do you enjoy science fiction with robots, androids, virtual worlds, and corporate conspiracies? <i>First of Their Kind</i> is the first book of the Chronicles of Theren, a centuries-spanning science fiction series that will force listeners to question what it truly means to be a person.</p> <p>It will invoke the character driven feel of a tale like <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i> by Philip K. Dick, but through a narrative that slowly unfolds upon a scale closer to that of <i>Dune</i> or <i>The Expanse</i>. But at the heart of <i>First of Their Kind</i>, you will experience the hopes and dreams of the first synthetic intelligences; the first SI. The story is through their eyes.</p> <p><i>First of Their Kind</i> is the first novel of Two Doctors Media Collaborative transformed into audio form; look for <i>Their Greatest Game</i>, its sequel.</p>";
