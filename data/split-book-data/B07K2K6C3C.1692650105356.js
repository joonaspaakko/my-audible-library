window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to the Wild North, a desolate wasteland where criminals go to hide - if they can outlast the drought and the dangers of the desert. Or the dangers of something else.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meet Nox, the Coilhunter. A mechanic and toymaker by trade, a bounty hunter by circumstance. He isn't in it for the money. He's in it for justice, and there's a lot of justice that needs to be paid.&nbsp;</p> <p>Between each kill, he's looking for someone who has kept out of his crosshairs for quite a while - the person who murdered his wife and children. The trail has long gone cold, but there are changes happening, the kind of changes that uncover footprints and spent bullet casings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plagued by nightmares, he's made himself into a living one, the kind the criminals and con men fear.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, welcome, fair folk, to the Wild North. If the land doesn't get you, the Coilhunter will.</p>";
