When his shift ends, he consumes all manner of superhero fiction—comics, books, or games. When an up-and-coming gaming company, Vert, announces a new superhero game—a game that promises infinite choice—Dylan is immediately ready to dive in. He has the perfect role in mind for himself: the egotistical supervillain from cartoons.</p> <p>Vert is more ambitious than anyone knew. As launch day for their new MMO World of Supers looms, they announce that if players do something really over-the-top, they can become a permanent raid boss inside the game. Now Dylan’s antics will be pitted against streamers bent on immortalizing themselves in the gaming world.</p> <p>When everyone else takes the game seriously, it’s only the casuals who have fun.</p>";
