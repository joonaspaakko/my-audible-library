window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A crashed wedding. A scorned vampire. Here comes the blood…</p> <p>Necromancer Damian Vesik is no hero. At least, not according to the magical community that turns a blind eye to his battles against evil. So he chalks it up as one more thankless mission when he’s forced to stop his vampire sister from murdering her ex’s entire bridal party....</p> <p>Infiltrating the ceremony to protect the innocent, Damian uncovers something even more sinister than a massacre. With the help of his berserker fairy friend, he may need to prevent an unholy union between ancient demons and the walking dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Damian has one chance to stop his sister and ruin the wedding before one hell of an afterparty dooms the world.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Days Gone Bad</i> is the first book in the savagely funny Vesik urban fantasy series.
