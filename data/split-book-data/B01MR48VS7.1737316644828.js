window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An oracle has predicted the sojourner's end, which is a problem for Adam insofar as he has never encountered an oracular prediction that didn't come true...and he is the sojourner. To survive, he's going to have to figure out what a beautiful ex-government analyst, an eco-terrorist, a rogue FBI agent, and the world's oldest religious cult all want with him, and fast. </p> <p>And all he wanted when he came to Vegas was to forget about a girl. And maybe have a drink or two. </p> <p>The second book in the Immortal series, <i>Hellenic Immortal</i> follows the continuing adventures of Adam, a 60,000-year-old man with a wry sense of humor, a flair for storytelling, and a knack for staying alive. <i>Hellenic Immortal</i> is a clever blend of history, mythology, sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, mystery and romance. A little something, in other words, for every listener. </p>";
