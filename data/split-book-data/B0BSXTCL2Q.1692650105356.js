With the carnival in town, people want to have a good time, but for many, this will be the worst time of their lives.</p> <p><b>“Alan Baxter is an accomplished storyteller who ably evokes magic and menace.” (Laird Barron, author of </b><b><i>Swift to Chase</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Baxter delivers the horror goods.” (Paul Tremblay, author of</b><b><i> A Head Full of Ghosts </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> The Cabin at the End of the World</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Step into the ring with Alan Baxter, I dare you.
