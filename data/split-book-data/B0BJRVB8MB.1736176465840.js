window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Buck Lake, Colorado, the resident dog catcher, Collins, is on the verge of retirement. But something strange lurks in the woods, about to ruin his plans....</p> <p>After 30 years, Collins is ready to be done with small-town animal control. His replacement, Blair, is a Gen Z vet student who hates mansplaining; they don’t get along. But on the eve of his retirement, Collins gets a call that changes everything.</p> <p>There’s been a report of a vicious wild dog on the loose. Collins and Blair head to a remote family farm to check it out. But instead of finding one wayward mutt, they’re attacked by an entire pack of bloodthirsty creatures. Are they animals? Aliens? Or something more sinister?</p> <p>Collins and Blair have never seen eye to eye, but they’ll have to learn to work together if they want to survive the night. The future of Buck Lake depends on it.</p> <p><i>Catchers </i>is a small-town horror tale with all the charm of a classic ‘80s creature-feature, updated for the modern era. Billy Gardell (<i>Bob Hearts Abishola</i>) stars as Collins alongside Herizen Guardiola (<i>American Gods</i>) as Blair.</p> <p>With hair-raising twists and a diverse cast of characters, <i>Catchers </i>has something to send shivers down every horror lover’s spine.</p>";
