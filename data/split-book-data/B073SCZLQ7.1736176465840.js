To confront and kill the person who murdered my parents and caused such unbearable heartache. </p> <p>Tokyo has other ideas. As neon burns my retinas, and bizarre, utterly foreign Hidden try to thwart me at every turn, I lose control. Obsessed, single-minded, and utterly deranged, I sink deeper and deeper into a desperate madness as I chase across the megalopolis seeking vengeance. </p> <p>They torture me, they blast me, they try to eat me, and they threaten my very soul, but they don't know what they're dealing with, and neither do I any longer. </p> <p>Strange powers stir inside my battered body, forces I have little control over, and it isn't long before this fury will explode and rain down bloody hell on all who stand in my way. </p> <p>I'm not called Black Spark for nothing, and my nemesis is going to pay for her crimes, even if it costs me my life. I'll show her; I'll show them all. </p> <p>Look out, Tokyo - the gaijin's in town. </p>";
