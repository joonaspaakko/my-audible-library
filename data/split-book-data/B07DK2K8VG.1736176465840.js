window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new anthology celebrating the witches and sorcerers of epic fantasy - featuring stories by George R. R. Martin, Scott Lynch, Megan Lindholm, and many others!</b></p> <p>Hot on the heels of Gardner Dozois’s acclaimed anthology <i>The Book of Swords</i> comes this companion volume devoted to magic. How could it be otherwise? For every Frodo, there is a Gandalf...and a Saruman. For every Dorothy, a Glinda...and a Wicked Witch of the West. What would Harry Potter be without Albus Dumbledore...and Severus Snape? Figures of wisdom and power, possessing arcane, often forbidden knowledge, wizards and sorcerers are shaped - or misshaped - by the potent magic they seek to wield. Yet though their abilities may be godlike, these men and women remain human - some might say all too human. Such is their curse. And their glory.</p> <p>In these pages, seventeen of today’s top fantasy writers - including award-winners Elizabeth Bear, John Crowley, Kate Elliott, K. J. Parker, Tim Powers, and Liz Williams - cast wondrous spells that thrillingly evoke the mysterious, awesome, and at times downright terrifying worlds where magic reigns supreme: worlds as far away as forever, and as near as next door.</p> <p><b>Featuring 16 all-new stories:</b></p> <p>\"The Return of the Pig\" by K. J.
