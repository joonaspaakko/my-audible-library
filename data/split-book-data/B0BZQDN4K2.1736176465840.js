window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2024 Sydney Taylor Book Award Young Adult Honor </b><br> <br> <b>\"Haunting, exhilarating, and a howl of vengeance.\" </b>—<b>Andrew Joseph White, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Hell Followed With Us</i></b><b><br> <br> </b><b><i>Frankenstein </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>Inglourious Basterds</i></b><b> in this stunning Jewish historical horror novel from the award-winning author of </b><b><i>The City Beautiful</i></b><br> <br> <i>Vera was made for vengeance.</i><br> <br> Lithuania, 1943. A father drowns in the all-consuming grief of a daughter killed by the Nazis. He can’t bring Chaya back from the dead, but he can use kishuf — an ancient and profane magic — to create a golem in her image. A Nazi killer, to avenge her death.<br> <br> When Vera awakens, she can feel her violent purpose thrumming within her. But she can also feel glimpses of a human life lived, of stolen kisses amidst the tragedy, and of a grisly death. And when she meets Akiva, she recognizes the boy with soft lips that gave warm kisses. But these memories aren’t hers, and Vera doesn’t know if she gets—or <i>deserves</i>—to have a life beyond what she was made for.<br> <br> Vera’s strength feels limitless—until she learns that there are others who would channel kishuf for means far less noble than avenging a daughter’s death. As she confronts the very basest of humanity, Vera will need more than what her creator gave her: Not just a reason to fight, but a reason to live. <br> <br> Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
