window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“High emotional stakes and an intriguing premise make this first entry in Foster’s new trilogy a solid next read for those who enjoyed Pierce Brown’s</b> <b><i>Red Rising</i></b> <b>or Veronica Roth’s</b> <b><i>Divergent</i></b><b>.\" (</b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>An alternate reality that feels all-too-real,</b> <b><i>The Rift Uprising</i></b> <b>is the explosive start to a new trilogy that blurs the line between parallel universes - not to mention YA and adult science fiction - from acclaimed lyricist and storyteller Amy S. Foster</b><b><i>.</i></b></p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Ryn Whittaker is a Citadel: an elite, enhanced soldier specially chosen to guard a Rift, a mysterious and dangerous portal to alternate Earths scientists cannot control or close. Trained from the age of 14, Ryn can run faster, jump farther, and fight better than a Navy SEAL - which is good when you’re not sure if a laser-wielding Neanderthal or an axe-wielding Viking is trying to make it through the Rift and into&nbsp;your world.</p> <p>But the teenager’s military conditioning and education have not prepared her for the boy who crosses through - a confused young man, seemingly lost and alone.&nbsp;While there’s an immediate physical attraction, it’s his intelligence and curiosity that throws Ryn off balance. The stranger asks disturbing questions about the Rift that Ryn herself has never considered - questions that lead her to wonder if everything about her life and what she’s been told these past six years has been a lie. Are the Rifts as dangerous as her leaders say? Should her people really try to close them...or learn how to travel through them?&nbsp;</p>";
