window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new series from the world of The Chronicles of Lumineia.</b> </p> <p><i>The Last Oracle</i>, book one: Forced into hiding, the mages of Lumineia have been forgotten. In their absence the world has become known by another name: Earth. The humans have flourished with time, unaware that The Last Oracle is destined to unite them. At her touch magic will be unbound and known again as truth. But an ancient war harbors a deadly secret. Draeken, the Lord of Chaos, had a second apprentice, one who became trapped with the defeated fiends. Fueled by revenge and dark magic, he has mastered a power that Draeken himself could not, and the time is fast approaching for it to be unleashed. The Dark is waiting.... </p> <p><i>The Sword of Elseerian</i>, book two: Led by the mysterious Master, the Harbingers have infiltrated the highest levels of the mage government. They mean to reveal the mages to the world - and then conquer it. To that end they have stolen the Sword of Elseerian and intend to open the portal to Draeken's vast army. But the fiends are gone. In their place another entity lurks. Caged for eons, the Dark feeds on fear...and light. If unleashed on Earth, it will devour every spark of illumination until mankind is left in darkness absolute. Madness and terror will rob men of their minds. Each will become an extension of the Dark, flesh without a soul. The Oracle and her allies have a desperate plan to retrieve the Sword of Elseerian before it can be used. If they fail, the Dark will be released. And the day will have its last dawn. </p> <p><i>Descent unto Dark</i>, book three: The Dark has been unleashed. Impervious to mage or man, its almighty power is matched only by its hunger. Unchecked it will devour the planet...until even the dawn is extinguished. Human and creature alike will become twisted, beasts slaved to the Dark's will. The leash is held by the Harbinger Master, who requires a simple offering to stay the impending slaughter. Obedience is absolute. </p>";
