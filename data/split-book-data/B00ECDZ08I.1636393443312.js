window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Mistborn Trilogy, Brandon Sanderson, comes the first book in a new, action-packed thrill ride of a series - Steelheart. Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his will.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nobody fights the Epics...nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.&nbsp;</p> <p>And David wants in. He wants Steelheart - the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning - and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>He's seen Steelheart bleed.&nbsp;</p> <p>And he wants revenge.</p>";
