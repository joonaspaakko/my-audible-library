A delicious modern fairy tale.”— Christopher Buehlman, Shirley Jackson Award-winning author</b><br> <br> <b>\"Katie Erich's Northern English accent transports listeners to the windswept Yorkshire moors in this atmospheric fantasy about a woman on the run.\" - </b><b><i>AudioFile </i></b><b>on </b><b><i>The Book Eaters</i></b><br> <br> <b><i>Truth is found between the stories we're fed and the stories we hunger for.</i></b><br> <br> Out on the Yorkshire Moors lives a secret line of people for whom books are food, and who retain all of a book's content after eating it. To them, spy novels are a peppery snack; romance novels are sweet and delicious. Eating a map can help them remember destinations, and children, when they misbehave, are forced to eat dry, musty pages from dictionaries. <br> <br> Devon is part of The Family, an old and reclusive clan of book eaters. Her brothers grow up feasting on stories of valor and adventure, and Devon—like all other book eater women—is raised on a carefully curated diet of fairy tales and cautionary stories.<br> <br> But real life doesn't always come with happy endings, as Devon learns when her son is born with a rare and darker kind of hunger—not for books, but for human minds.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.</b></p>";
