window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A bewitchingly cozy, fiendishly funny cautionary tale about the perils of gatecrashing fairytale kingdoms—particularly ones with drunken unicorns, bored dragons, and sorcerers in tight leather pants.</b></p> <p>Sasha Pierce hasn’t had a single dream since she was a child...until she accepts a substitute teaching position in the charmingly witchy village of Old Middleton. Her first dream in twenty-five years ought to be enchanting, but her wonder quickly turns to shock when she realizes that it’s not a dream at all, but an entirely different sort of magic.</p> <p>Catapulted through an ancient portal into the fairytale kingdom of Between, Sasha’s astonishment is swiftly upgraded to panic when she accidentally performs a supposedly impossible feat and is declared the True Queen of Between...and betrothed to its infuriatingly handsome sorcerer king.</p> <p>Lorn, Shadow King of Between, is desperate to break free from Between’s clutches. Magically tethered to the ramshackle kingdom, he wages a daily battle to save his disreputable subjects from rampaging magical creatures, sinkholes, and catastrophes of the distressingly lethal variety. To avoid an early grave, he needs an escape plan, not a wife...until he learns that this magicless mortal holds the key to his freedom.</p> <p>Unwilling to leave her world to accept the crown—or the husband—Sasha must race against the clock to disentangle herself from this fairytale. But her empty throne leaves a dangerous rift between their worlds. As dark forces descend upon Old Middleton, the two must make a choice: work together or unleash fairytale chaos upon their realms.</p> <p><i>Between </i>is the spellbinding first novel in The Chronicles of Between fantasy series. Filled with feisty, fairytale-savvy heroines, swoon-worthy sorcerers, slow burn romance, morose minotaurs, and bawdy witches, it’s a laugh-out-loud fairy tale romp.</p>";
