Trained to hunt and kill vampires over 300 years ago, my training became essential once I became one of those monsters.</p> <p>The underbelly of the supernatural world has begun to bleed into the human world, and journalist Rachel Sambrook is asking too many dangerous questions. Unwittingly, she's revealed a conspiracy I had hoped would never become a reality: using vampire blood for human experiments.</p> <p>As I attempt to contain her, she's by my side, and the truth of just how deep the darkness goes is exposed. Unfortunately, the consequences have also brought forth the creatures that hide around every corner, thirsty for flesh.</p> <p>The only question remaining is which one of us will survive the inevitable bloodbath?</p>";
