Now, Apollo is a father himself - and as he and his wife, Emma, settle into their new lives as parents, exhaustion and anxiety start to take their toll. Apollo's old dreams return, and Emma begins acting odd. At first, Emma seems to be exhibiting signs of postpartum depression. But before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act and vanishes. Thus begins Apollo’s quest to find a wife and child who are nothing like he'd imagined. His odyssey takes him to a forgotten island, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. </p> <p><b>Named One of </b><b><i>Paste</i></b><b>’s Best Horror Books of the Decade • Named One of the Best Books of the Year by </b><b><i>The New York Times • USA Today • The New York Public Library • NPR • BuzzFeed • Kirkus Reviews • Book Riot </i></b></p> <p>“The thriller you won’t be able to put down.” (<i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i>)</p> <p>“By turns enchanting, infuriating, horrifying, and heartbreaking, <i>The Changeling</i> is never less than completely engaging.” (NPR)</p> <p>“Strange and wonderful.” (<i>The New York Times</i>)</p> <p>“A dark fairy tale of New York, full of magic and loss, myth and mystery, love and madness. <i>The Changeling</i> is a mesmerizing, monumental work.” (Marlon James, author of <i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i>)</p> <p>“[A] bewitching masterpiece....
