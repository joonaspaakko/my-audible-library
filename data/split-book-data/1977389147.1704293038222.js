window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A witch outrunning her past. Five smoldering-hot guardians. And the dark secret that could destroy them all....</p> <p>Blackmoon Bay is a city of monsters. Surviving here means never leaving home without a sharp stake. It means keeping secrets, even from friends. And unless I want the Hunters finding me again, it means my witchcraft stays on permanent lockdown. Good policy - until the night I accidentally resurrect a dead girl, rekindling my magic and drawing the Bay's most dangerous men to my doorstep.</p> <p>Asher, the bad-boy incubus. Darius, the cunning, oh-so-sexy vampire. Emilio, the wolf shifter with a big heart and a treacherous past. Ronan, the only demon I trust with my soul. And Death himself, bound to my magic for reasons I don't understand. Together they've sworn to protect me from the evil out there, but it's not the evil out there I'm worried about.&nbsp;</p> <p>A shadow lurks inside me, black and deadly as a bomb. And I'm pretty sure my magical mishap just lit the fuse. I'm Gray Desario. Witch. Survivor. Occasional bringer of chaos. And tonight? The darkness is coming....</p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
