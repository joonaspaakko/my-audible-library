window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>All Systems Red</i> is the tense first science fiction adventure novella in Martha Wells' series The Murderbot Diaries. For fans of <i>Westworld</i>, <i>Ex Machina</i>, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels. </p> <p><i>All Systems Red </i>tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans. </p> <p>In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. </p> <p>But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern. </p> <p>On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied 'droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \"Murderbot.\" </p> <p>Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth. </p>";
