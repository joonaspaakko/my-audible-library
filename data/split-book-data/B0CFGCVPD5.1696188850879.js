Crimefighting is illegal, punishable by life in prison at the bottom of the ocean. It sucks. But that won't stop me from doing what I was born to do: uphold justice and stop good people from being hurt.</p> <p>Even if everyone I once called a friend is against me, I'm not bowing down to the Counter Vigilante Taskforce.</p> <p>My name is Sawyer William Vincent. (I know, it's three first names. Think I haven't heard that before?) Once known as Red Raptor, I'm now Black Harrier, one of the world's most famous masked crime-fighters, and this is my city.
