window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>New, from the best-selling author of <i>The Spaceship Next Door</i>! </p> <p>\"I thought I'd miss the world.\" - Adam the Immortal </p> <p>Adam is on vacation in an island paradise, with nothing to do and plenty of time to do nothing. </p> <p>It's exactly what he needed: beautiful weather, beautiful girlfriend, plenty of books to read, and alcohol to drink. Most importantly, either nobody on the island knows who he is, or, nobody cares. </p> <p>\"This probably sounds boring, and maybe it is. It's possible I have no compass to help determine boring, or maybe I have a different threshold than most people. From my perspective, though, the vast majority of human history has been boring, by which I mean nothing happened, and sure, that can be dull. On the other hand, nothing happening includes nobody trying to kill anybody, and specifically, nobody trying to kill me. That's the kind of boring a guy can get behind.\" - Adam the Immortal </p> <p>Nothing last forever, though, and that includes the opportunity to do nothing. One day, unwelcome visitors arrive in secret, with impossible knowledge of impossible events, and then the impossible things arrive: a new species. </p> <p>It's all impossible, especially to the immortal man who thought he'd seen all there was to see in the world. Now, Adam is going to have to figure out what's happening and make things right before he and everyone he loves ends up dead in the hot sun of this island paradise. </p> <p><i>Immortal and the Island of Impossible Things</i> is the fourth book in Gene Doucette's acclaimed Immortal novel series, and the start of a new adventure for Adam the Immortal man! Catch up on all that's come before with <i>Immortal</i>, <i>Hellenic Immortal</i>, <i>Immortal at the Edge of the World</i>, and the novellas in The Immortal Chronicles and <i>Immortal Stories: Eve</i>. </p>";
