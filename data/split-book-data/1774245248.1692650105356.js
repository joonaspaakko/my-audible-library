The Moonsworn healers would fight the Wrack, but must navigate distrust and violence from the peoples of Teringia. Proud Galicanta readies itself for war, as the Sunsworn Empire watches and waits for the Wrack to bring its rival low.</p> <p><i>The Wrack</i> advances, utterly unconcerned with the plans of men.</p>";
