In need of a fresh start, and compelled by strange dreams, the couple decide to rent a lake house in the idyllic town of Gilchrist, Massachusetts, a place where bad things might just happen for a reason. As bizarre events begin to unfold around them - a chance encounter with a gifted six-year-old boy, a series of violent deaths, and repeated sightings of a strange creature with a terrifying nature - Peter and Sylvia are drawn into the chaos and soon discover that coming to Gilchrist may not have been their decision at all.</p> <p>Set against a small New England town in the summer of 1966, <i>Gilchrist</i> is a sinister tale about the haunting origins of violence, evil, and the undying power of memory.</p>";
