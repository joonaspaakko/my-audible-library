Keeping it is another story. </b></p> <p>After inciting rebellion against Earth throughout Titan's off-world colonies, Kale learns that leadership isn't only about fighting. Keeping control of his people - even his own family - requires a different set of skills. Following a pivotal battle over Saturn, Kale travels deep into enemy territory under the guise of seeking peace, though peace is the last thing on his mind. </p> <p>Malcolm Graves used to be an infamous Collector for a powerful Earther corporation, until he nearly lost his life on Titan. Now he's retired. But when Kale's wake of destruction follows Malcolm to Mars and claims the life of a friend, it's time for the ex-Collector to dust off his pulse-pistol and leap back into a fight he thought he'd left behind. </p> <p>With the solar system divided, heroes are few and short-lived...but someone has to put the self-proclaimed King of Titan in his place. </p> <p>Get Book 3 in the best-selling Children of Titan Series today!</p>";
