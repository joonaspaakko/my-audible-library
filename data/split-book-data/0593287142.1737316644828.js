window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Genre-bending and darkly comic, Grushin's fourth novel is a weird and wonderful triumph.\" (</b><b><i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Cinderella wants her Prince Charming dead in this sophisticated fairy-tale for the 21st century.</b> </p> <p>Cinderella married the man of her dreams - the perfect ending she deserved after diligently following all the fairy-tale rules. Yet now, 13 and a half years later, things have gone badly wrong, and her life is far from perfect. One night, fed up and exhausted, she sneaks out of the palace to get help from the witch who, for a price, offers love potions to disgruntled housewives. But as the old hag flings the last ingredients into the cauldron, Cinderella doesn't ask for a love spell to win back her Prince Charming. Instead, she wants him dead.</p> <p>Endlessly surprising, wildly inventive, and decidedly modern, <i>The Charmed Wife</i> weaves together time and place, fantasy and reality, to conjure a world unlike any other. Nothing in it is quite what it seems - the twists and turns of its magical, dark, and swiftly shifting paths take us deep into the heart of what makes us unique, of romance and marriage, and of the very nature of storytelling.</p>";
