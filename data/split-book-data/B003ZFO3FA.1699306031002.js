window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> is one of literature’s earliest works of science fiction. It vividly animates a fantastical subterranean world as an intrepid crew, led by the eccentric Otto Lidenbrock, traverses the planet’s core and its various bizarre obstacles: giant mushrooms and insects, a herd of mastodons, prehistoric humans, a treacherous pit of magma, and more. </p> <p>Tim Curry, narrator of the customer favorite <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, returns for an encore performance that delivers a range of distinct character voices and captures the energy and enthusiasm of a time when scientific exploration was a brand new adventure.</p>";
