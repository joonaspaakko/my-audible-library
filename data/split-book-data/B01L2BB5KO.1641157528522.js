window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A legend is born. In 1972, Jeff Rice's novel <i>The Night Stalker</i> introduced Carl Kolchak to the world. This spine-tingling novel of supernatural terror became a best seller and served as the basis for the film of the same name, starring Darren McGavin and adapted by legendary <i>Twilight Zone</i> screenwriter Richard Matheson. After <i>The Night Stalker</i> became one of the highest-rated television movies of all time, a sequel, <i>The Night Strangler</i>, was released the following year to great acclaim. </p> <p>Carl Kolchak, as the world's first paranormal investigator, would prove to be an irresistible draw for viewers and inspire a weekly dramatic television series which debuted in 1974. </p> <p>A legend returns. Now, after more than three decades out of print, Kolchak's creator Jeff Rice has released the original novels which sparked the television phenomenon! At last, <i>The Night Stalker</i> and <i>The Night Strangler</i> are together in one volume: <i>The Kolchak Papers</i>! </p> <p>Twenty-one years before Kolchak inspired Chris Carter to create <i>The X-Files</i>, there was only one paranormal investigator. Now fans everywhere can relive the adventures of Carl Kolchak in this single, remarkable volume! </p>";
