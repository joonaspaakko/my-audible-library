The Organization believes an imposter has infiltrated the Group, and they have instructed Ishmael to root him - or her - out. It's not Ishmael's only mission. The first agent sent by the Organization has been found dead in her room, murdered in a horribly gruesome manner. Ishmael must also discover who killed Jennifer Rifkin, his fellow agent - and why.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dismissive of rumors that the legendary \"Coronach Creature\" is behind Jennifer's death, Ishmael sets out to expose the human killer in their midst. But he must act fast - before any more very important people are killed.</p>";
