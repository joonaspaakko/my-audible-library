The Death Mage killed my mother - he might also be my father. </p> <p>I can't lose my head, though. The mage wields an evil, mind-warping magic. A power that undermines his victims' sanity while pledging their souls to an ancient being and devourer of worlds. </p> <p>How would I even know if his magic was corrupting me? </p> <p>Or is it already? </p>";
