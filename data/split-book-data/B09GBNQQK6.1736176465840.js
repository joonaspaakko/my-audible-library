window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Those who see the dead soon join them.</i></b></p> <p><b>From the author of the critically acclaimed Blackwing trilogy comes Ed McDonald's </b><b><i>Daughter of Redwinter</i></b><b>, the first of a brilliant fantasy series about how one choice can change a universe.</b></p> <p>Raine can see—and speak—to the dead, a gift that comes with a death sentence. All her life she has hidden, lied, and run to save her skin, and she’s made some spectacularly bad choices along the way.</p> <p>But it is a rare act of kindness—rescuing an injured woman in the snow—that becomes the most dangerous decision Raine has ever made. Dangerous because the woman is fleeing from Redwinter, the fortress-monastery of the Draoihn, warrior magicians who answer to no king, and who will stop at nothing to reclaim what she’s stolen. A battle, a betrayal, and a horrific revelation force Raine to enter the citadel and live among the Draoihn. She soon finds that her secret ability could be the key to saving an entire nation.</p> <p>Though she might have to die to make it happen . . .</p> <p>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.</p>";
