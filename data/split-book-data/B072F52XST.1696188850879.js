Through a series of mishaps and misfortune, the duo find themselves in possession of a mysterious black case. In order to survive, they must fend off murderous marauders, an interplanetary police force, and a peculiar crime boss and escape a backwater planet inhabited by alien hillbillies. It's a big and scary universe out there, and Chuck and Jopp will be damned if they're going to face it sober. </p>";
