Harder to say when this new talent arrived. But Lion Zorn is the first of his kind—an empathy tracker, an emotional soothsayer, with a felt sense for the future of the we. In simpler terms, he can spot cultural shifts and trends before they happen.<br> <br> It’s a useful skill for a certain kind of company.<br> <br> Arctic Pharmaceuticals is that kind of company.
