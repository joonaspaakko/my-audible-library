window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>American Gods</i> vs. Baba Yaga in this Russian-inspired contemporary fantasy <i>Spring's Arcana</i>, by <i>New York Times</i> bestseller Lilith Saintcrow.</b><br><br>Nat Drozdova is desperate to save a life. Doctors can do little for her cancer-ridden mother, who insists there is only one cure—and that Nat must visit a skyscraper in Manhattan to get it.<br><br>Amid a snow-locked city, inside a sleek glass-walled office, Nat makes her plea and is whisked into a terrifying new world. For the skyscraper holds a hungry winter goddess who has the power to cure her mother…<i>if</i> Nat finds a stolen object of great power.<br><br>Now Nat must travel with a razor-wielding assassin across an American continent brimming with terror, wonder, and hungry divinities with every reason to consume a young woman. For her ailing mother is indeed suffering no ordinary illness, and Nat Drozdova is no ordinary girl. Blood calls to blood, magic to magic, and a daughter may indeed save what she loves...<br><br>…if it doesn’t consume her first.<br><br><i>This is the way to the Dead God’s Heart.<br><br></i><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.</b></p>";
