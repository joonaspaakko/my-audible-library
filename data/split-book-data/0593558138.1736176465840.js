[with a] rich fantasy landscape and an almost Shakespearean feel.”—</b><b><i>Paste</i></b><b><br> <br> Twins imbued with incredible magic and near-immortality will do anything to keep their family in power—even if it tears the family apart—in the first book of a mythic epic fantasy duology from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of</b> <b><i>Wilder Girls</i></b><b>.</b><br> <b><i><br> </i></b><b>ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022—</b><b><i>BookPage</i></b><br> <br> Rhea and Lexos were born into a family unlike any other. Together with their siblings, they control the seasons, the tides, and the stars, and help their father rule their kingdom. Thanks to their magic, the family has ruled for an eternity, and plan to rule for an eternity more. <br> <br> But Rhea and Lexos are special: They are twins, bonded down to the bone, and for the past hundred years, that bond has protected them as their father becomes an unpredictable tyrant—and his worsening temper threatens the family’s grip on power. <br> <br> Now, with rival nations ready to attack, and a rebel movement within their own borders, Rhea and Lexos must fight to keep the kingdom—and the family—together, even as treachery, deceit, and drama threaten to strand the twins on opposite sides of the battlefield. <br> <br> <i>In a Garden Burning Gold</i> is a vividly written, atmospheric saga that explores the limits of power and the bonds of family—and how far both can be bent before they break.</p>";
