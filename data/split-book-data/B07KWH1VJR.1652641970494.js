It's how she snagged her first job pinpointing cheaters at a casino.<br> <br> But she has no clue where she got these freakish powers because she spent her childhood jumping from home to home in the foster system, and her father left her with nothing more than a cryptic note.<br> <br> Then she crosses paths with a terrifyingly real monster. Which is when a mysterious and annoyingly arrogant young warlock named Wade Crowley steps in, introducing her to a hidden world of beasts, magicals, and covens riddled with secrets - as well as clues about her murky past.<br> <br> Whether she likes it or not, this new world is where she belongs. But after a disturbing twist of events, Harley quickly realizes that her past is darker than she could ever have imagined.<br> <br> And that someone in the coven is out for her blood.<br> <br> With the help of Wade and her new friends, she must figure out who the traitor is and why they're targeting her... Before the human and magical worlds dangerously collide.<br> <br> <b>Potter fans, welcome to an exciting new world.</b><br> _____________________________________________<br> <br> If you love J.K.
