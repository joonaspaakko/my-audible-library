But when a little girl in the area goes missing, an all-out search ensues, reviving the decades-old campfire story of Ava Coons, the murderess, who still roams the woods. Joining the search, Wren stumbles upon the Coons cabin ruins and a rotting porcelain doll. But even more terrifying is seeing her name etched on the doll's foot like a sinister omen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1930, Ava Coons has spent the last ten years carrying the mantle of mystery since she emerged from the forest as an eight-year-old girl, spattered with blood, dragging a logger's axe. She has accepted she'll never remember what happened to her family.&nbsp;</p> <p>When a member of the town of Tempter's Creek is murdered, rumors spread that Ava's secret is more malicious than previously imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Both women discover that to save the innocent, they must face an insidious evil.</p>";
