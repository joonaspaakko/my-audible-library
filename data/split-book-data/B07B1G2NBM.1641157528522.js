Call it whatever you like.</p> <p>I take out the nightmares, demons, and werewolves. The things that lurk in the shadows around you. Guys like us call them Nightkind.</p> <p>And here I was, set to quit this dark life and retire to sunnier climes, except for one final job. There's always one. This time a call to eliminate a cruel, rogue vampire, named Mr. Tudor. Simple, right?</p> <p>Sure. Until the bodies started piling up in a new wave of vicious occult killings leading scarily close to my own front door, sparking a series of deadly events that would make my years of fighting the Nightkind look like a cakewalk.</p> <p>Add high-octane chases across the city, a game of shadows, and undead assassins all topped off by a trip into the terrifying world between worlds - the last place you'd ever want to find yourself.</p> <p>And the clues...they're all adding up to something...something big...and they're right in the palm of my hand.</p> <p>The missing piece of the puzzle? How in the hell I fit into all of this....</p>";
