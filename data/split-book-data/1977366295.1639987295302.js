window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's been three long years since Deadbreak. That's what everyone's calling it - the day the dead rose. Every day since then, Jeremiah Reid has had one goal: to make his way back to his daughter. With his four-legged companion, Joe, Jeremiah has to travel a lawless wasteland teeming with zombies, bandits, and worse, like people who put anchovies on pizza (you know who you are).&nbsp;</p> <p>It's a new world out there, and no one is safe. People are weary, cities are in ruin, supplies are scarce, and brains are on the menu. If he's going to have a chance, he'll need his wits, a little bit of luck, and lots of ammo.</p>";
