window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Centuries ago, the followers of the new gods defeated the old gods and the folk of legend, banishing them from the world of man. With their departure, magic faded from the land.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Milesian Accords had provisions for a new challenge, though, and the Exiled Gods have sent their minions back to our world to seek out a champion to fight for them and a druid able to wield the magic needed to fulfill the challenge.&nbsp;</p> <p>A descendant of the druid who participated in the original challenge, Liam Knox doesn’t know anything about the Accords or his ancestors, but those seeking to maintain the status quo are hunting him, and the beings of myth are doing their best to convince him to help the Exiled Gods return to the world of man, bringing magic back with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Liam is faced with a choice he doesn’t want, and if he chooses wrong, he risks more than his own life - he could end the world as we know it. And he’s running out of time to decide.</p>";
