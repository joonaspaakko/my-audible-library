window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Shadow and Bone</i></b><b>, now a hit NETFLIX series.</b></p> <p><b>The smash </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller from Leigh Bardugo, a mesmerizing tale of power, privilege, and dark magic set among the Ivy League elite. This program includes a bonus conversation with the author.</b></p> <p><b>\"The best fantasy novel I’ve read in years, because it’s about real people.... Impossible to put down.\"—Stephen King</b></p> <p><b>\"Bardugo’s latest is a must-listen, introducing a haunting, Yale-based occult world populated with gloriously complicated characters.... A win-win-win, honestly.\"—</b><b><i>Paste</i></b><b>, best audiobooks of 2019</b></p> <p>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug-dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. In fact, by age twenty, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most prestigious universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?</p> <p>Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. Their eight windowless “tombs” are the well-known haunts of the rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street’s biggest players. But their occult activities are more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive. They tamper with forbidden magic. They raise the dead. And, sometimes, they prey on the living. </p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books.</b></p>";
