window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After solving the Grendel Affair, the agents have another SPI file to investigate.... We're Supernatural Protection &amp; Investigations, known as SPI. We battle the real monsters of myth and legend, but this Halloween we're searching for diamonds.... </p> <p>A gala opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has attracted the upper crust of Manhattan - and thieves. A trio of vile harpies attacks the crowd and steals the stars of the exhibition: a colorful cluster of seven cursed diamonds known as the Dragon Eggs. In the right mage's hands, each stone can pack a magical wallop. Together they have the power to \"cure\" the supernaturals of the tristate area - but for many of those vampires and werewolves, that means turning into dust. </p> <p>I'm Makenna Fraser, a seer for SPI. With the help of my partner, Ian, and the other agents, I have 24 hours to prevent total global panic, find the diamonds, and save the supernatural community. No biggie....</p>";
