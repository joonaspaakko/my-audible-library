window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>New York City, 1946. No one knows his real name, but when the job is too dirty, too dangerous, they call Kissyman.</p> <p>Once an elite Nazi SS commando, an honorable soldier, a taker of lives. When he was assigned to Dachau and saw what he was actually fighting for, he went AWOL and ran as far away as he could - to America. He still makes his living with a gun, but he no longer kills for his country. Now, he kills for cash.</p> <p>A dashing, high-profile bodyguard known as “The Gentleman” is hired to protect Beth Copenhaver, an up-and-coming Hollywood starlet. When a man named Mathis Wrenn surfaces from Beth's past and threatens her life, the Gentleman hires Kissyman to make Mr. Wrenn see the error of his ways.</p> <p>It should be a simple job, but there is far more to the connection between Wrenn and Beth than the bombshell lets on. She's starring in a new movie with John Wayne called <i>Western Dawn</i>. As the premier approaches, Kissyman has to get to Wrenn before Wrenn can get to Beth.</p> <p><i>Kissyman &amp; the Gentleman</i> is two-fisted, nonstop noir action that draws you deep into the murderous world of this most unlikely hero.</p>";
