window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A starving city. A renegade bootlegger. A battle for the future of mankind.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Zeke is a bad guy. He didn’t choose to be. It’s just who he is. It’s who he has to be to survive in a post-apocalyptic world where trust is as scarce as water.&nbsp;</p> <p>He's got nobody. No family. No friends. And he left behind the woman he loved for her own good.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it's time to change. After a brush with death far out in the wasteland, he decides he's done risking his life to help his greedy bosses control who gets to drink water and when.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, he's stranded in a bar in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the perfect kind of ruffians who can help him go back and make things right. Armed with renewed purpose and a one-of-a-kind muscle car, Zeke hunts for redemption, seeks retribution and, maybe, just maybe, he can get his girl back while he’s at it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Take a ride across the wasteland in Tom Abrahams' newest post-apocalyptic, dystopian series, but with a fantasy twist. It will leave you wondering just what it means to be human.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>It's perfect for fans of A.G. Riddle, Hugh Howey, and Stephen King's The Dark Tower.</b></p>";
