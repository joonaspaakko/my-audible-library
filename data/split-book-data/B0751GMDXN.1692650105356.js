Before the four can think about their own futures, they will have to defeat an evil that wants to destroy the future altogether. </p> <p>The epic conclusion to the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Jackaby series features sly humor and a quirky cast of unforgettable characters as they face off against their most dangerous, bone-chilling foe ever. </p>";
