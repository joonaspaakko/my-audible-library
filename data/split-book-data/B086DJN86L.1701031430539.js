window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Their world isn't quite what it seems. It might not be a world at all...</b></p> <p>Udo's biggest problem isn't being a digger (that's low class), or staying drunk (that's damn expensive), or avoiding the Dwergaz (they're monsters), or even pissing off the supposed Gods.</p> <p>It's that his reality...well, it isn't what he thought.</p> <p>And now, he can't even afford to drink because his so-called friend Nicz is cutting into his business, digging up tin, iron, and copper. So Udo forms a new plan: clay. After all, clay jars are used to store everything: meat, herbs, and, his personal favorite, ale.</p> <p>But in his hunt for clay, Udo drills too far, is captured by the Dwergaz, and brought to the goddess Ing - or what he believes is a goddess. As Udo digs deeper into his world, and not just by digging holes, what he discovers is far beyond mountains and gods and monsters.</p> <p>There may be other worlds beyond his. Worlds surrounding other stars. In fact, his own home may not be a world at all.</p> <p><i>Udo the Digger</i> bends the tropes of science fiction and fantasy into a wild adventure that will amuse and surprise even veterans of both genres. It's perfect for fans of Arthur C. Clarke's <i>Rama</i>, <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, and <i>Book of the Long Sun</i>.</p>";
