He's fought spider-dragons, battled space clowns, and been repeatedly tortured by the galaxy's oldest assassin.</p> <p>And don't even get him started on the squirrel-tits.</p> <p>Now all that's behind him, Cal just wants to kick back and relax. The universe, however, has other ideas.&nbsp;</p> <p>He and his crew find themselves in possession of the Symmorium Sentience, a once god-like entity now stripped of its power. The Sentience needs help to return home and restore the Symmorium species, which recently found itself the subject of an unfortunate genocide.&nbsp;</p> <p>But with dark forces seeking to turn the Sentience's power into a planet-pulverizing weapon, the team's trek across the galaxy becomes a desperate race against time, with the fate of the very cosmos at stake.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Featuring awkward space-dates, gene-splicing villains, and a packet of coconut fingers as old as time itself, </b><b><i>Sentienced to Death</i></b><b> is the 11th book in the bestselling Space Team series by multi-award-winning author Barry J. Hutchison, and perfect for fans of funny stuff happening in space.</b></p>";
