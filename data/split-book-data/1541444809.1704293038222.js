You get my point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>So imagine my surprise when I find out everything I've ever been told, is a lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Let's start from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My name is Ruby Morningstar. I run a tattoo parlor in Portland with my best friend, have a pet raccoon, a crazy ex who stalks me, not to mention this one little thing...I'm a demon. Half-succubus, to be exact. For the last 23 years of my life, that's the story I believed, but on the day a handsome stranger bails me out of jail my world is turned upside down, and suddenly I don't know who I am anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Because the Four Horsemen aren't the bringers of the apocalypse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Talk about never catching a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
