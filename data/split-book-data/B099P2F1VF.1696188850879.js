Hell on earth doesn’t stand a chance.</i></b></p> <p>Now that I’ve dealt with Badb and proven to the Celtic gods that I’m a force to be reckoned with, it’s time to address some unfinished business....</p> <p><i>The Hellpocalypse.</i></p> <p>Just thinking about that place makes me break out in a cold sweat, and since I started planning this journey, the nightmares have come back with a vengeance.</p> <p>Do I really want to revisit that hellhole? Absolutely not, but folks there are depending on me - innocents who won’t survive unless I return to protect them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Besides, it’s my fault that the Hellpocalypse exists, so it’s my responsibility to fix it.</p> <p>Of course, this time it’ll be different.</p> <p>When Gwydion stranded me there, I had no warning or time to prepare. But for cripes’ sake, I’m a master druid now - a little ol’ paranormal apocalypse will be a cake walk.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ll just zip in, kill some master vampires, stop the spread of the vyrus, and be back in time for dinner with my girlfriend.</p> <p>In short? It’s time to cast magic and chew bubblegum...and I’m all out of bubblegum.</p> <p><i>Druid’s Folly</i> is an urban fantasy romp through present-day Austin, Texas, and an alternate history, post-apocalyptic version of The Lonestar State.</p> <p>If you enjoy paranormal action and adventure novels that are full of magic, guns, explosions, vampires, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, and necromancers, you’ll love this first book in the Colin McCool Trickster Cycle trilogy.</p> <p>Grab your copy today and find out what 200,000+ book lovers already know...that M.D. Massey’s Druidverse is a world tailor-made for fans of urban fantasy and paranormal suspense.</p>";
