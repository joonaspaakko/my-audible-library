window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>FROM THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF LOST IN TIME</b></p> <p><b>At CERN, a scientist has just made an incredible discovery—a breakthrough that may answer the deepest questions about human existence.</b></p> <p><b>But what he's found is far more dangerous than he ever imagined.</b></p> <p>Dr. Tyson Klein is a quantum physicist who has dedicated his entire life to his research. At CERN, he analyses data generated by the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. Now, Ty believes he's found a pattern in its output. It looks like an organised data stream, being broadcast over what he calls a quantum radio.</p> <p>Could it be a signal from another universe? A message sent from the future? Or something else entirely?</p> <p>As Ty peels back the layers of his discovery, he learns that what he's found isn't what he thought it was. The encoded message is far more profound. It may alter our understanding of human existence and the universe.</p> <p>But Ty is not the only one looking for it. Someone has been following his research for a long time. And they'll do anything to prevent him from unravelling what is being broadcast by the quantum radio...</p> <p>Because the first one to discover the truth may well control the future.</p>";
