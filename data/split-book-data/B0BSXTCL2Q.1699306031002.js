An old evil is rising, and only one man seems to realize that everyone is in danger and this is not the first time it’s happened. With the carnival in town, people want to have a good time, but for many, this will be the worst time of their lives.</p> <p><b>“Alan Baxter is an accomplished storyteller who ably evokes magic and menace.” (Laird Barron, author of </b><b><i>Swift to Chase</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Baxter delivers the horror goods.” (Paul Tremblay, author of</b><b><i> A Head Full of Ghosts </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> The Cabin at the End of the World</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Step into the ring with Alan Baxter, I dare you.
