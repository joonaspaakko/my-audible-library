He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure.&nbsp;<br> <br> So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness.&nbsp;<br> <br> Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled&nbsp;<i>Armada—</i>in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders.&nbsp;<br> <br> As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity's life in the balance.&nbsp;<br> <br> But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this scenario feel a little bit like . . .&nbsp; well . . . fiction?&nbsp;<br> <br> At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics,<i>&nbsp;Armada</i>&nbsp;is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you've ever heard before.</p>";
