window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Uncover the lost years of Critical Role’s unrelentingly upbeat undead spellcaster in this original prequel novel to Laudna’s adventures with Bells Hells.</b></p> <p>For as long as she can remember, Laudna has had a friend. A mentor. A little voice whispering in her cropped ear, promising that, no matter how monstrous she becomes or how far she wanders, there will always be someone to guide her.</p> <p>And so, Laudna is content.</p> <p>But the thought of <i>more</i>—of life, of love, of the magic stirring in her still veins—is unrelenting in its familiarity. <i>More</i> is the dream of the young girl trapped behind the bloodstained walls of Whitestone, and the nightmare of the woman who now stalks the woods outside them. <i>More, </i>Laudna’s little voice reminds her, is dangerous. From Tal’Dorei to Marquet, the world is infested with heroes destined to rid their kingdoms of creatures like Laudna.</p> <p>The little voice is right, she knows.</p> <p>But still, she thinks of <i>more</i>. And when she reaches for that dream, what reaches back will change everything.</p> <p>Written by <i>USA Today </i>bestselling author Cassandra Khaw, <i>Critical Role: Bells Hells—What Doesn’t Break</i> delves into the unexplored years before Laudna joined up with the crew of Bells Hells, chronicling her departure from Whitestone and her solo adventures on the road to Jrusar.</p>";
