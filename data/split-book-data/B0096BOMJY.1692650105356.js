window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Dirty Streets of Heaven</i> is the first in a new set of fantasy-fuelled thrillers from the author George R. R. Martin cites as one of the major inspirations behind <i>Game of Thrones</i>: Tad Williams, international best-selling author of <i>The Dragonbone Chair.</i> </p> <p>Bobby Dollar isn’t your average angel! Sure, he takes the occasional trip to Heaven, but his job as an advocate - arguing the fate of the recently deceased - keeps him pretty busy on Earth, and he's more than happy to spend the rest of his time propping up the bar with his fellow immortals. Until the day a soul goes missing, presumed stolen by \"the other side\". </p> <p>A new chapter in the war between heaven and hell is about to open. And Bobby is right in the middle of it, with only a desirable but deadly demon to aid him.</p>";
