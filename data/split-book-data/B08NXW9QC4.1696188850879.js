Most people inherit a house, a pet, or money. Max Abaddon wasn’t so lucky. His gramps left him a job that required him to learn that magic was real, and he’d better learn how to use it. Soon....</p> <p>In his new role Max works with a team of eccentric mages based out of a facility called the Atheneum that has for a very long time managed the relationship between the normal world and well everything else.</p> <p>To make matters worse, a string of high-profile murders ensure his transition is not going to be an easy one.
