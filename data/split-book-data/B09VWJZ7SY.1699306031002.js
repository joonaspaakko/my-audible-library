window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Boldly going because they're completely lost.\"</b></p> <p>The newly renamed Vance Turbo has sabotaged his own career at Space Fleet Academy due to a desire to atone for a training accident. Unfortunately, his actions result in him getting press-ganged into an expendable crew of misfits recruited by a legendary starship captain. Their mission? To recover a collection of lost sun-destroying missiles that could restart a galactic war. Unfortunately, Vance is smart enough to know something is wrong with this picture. After all, no sane person would recruit this crew to save the universe.</p> <p>Space Academy is an all-new series from the hilarious duo of C.T. Phipps (Supervillainy Saga, Agent G) and Michael Suttkus (<i>I Was a Teenage Weredeer</i>, Lucifer's Star) that lampoons the space opera as well as military science fiction genres.</p>";
