window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to <i>The Codex</i> - Omnibus edition. </p> <p>This special edition includes the epic origin story, <i>Failed Crusade</i>, that inspired five volumes of demon hunting across the multiverse (and multiple genres.) This fantasy story has an amazing twist ending. </p> <p>The original Codex stories appeared in <i>The Crimson Pact</i> anthologies as <i>The Transition</i> and <i>The Merging</i>. These stories are connected to each other, and to <i>Failed Crusade</i> at their roots, but occur many years later. They follow an unsuspecting foreign exchange student named Sloan Boyle. A seemingly innocent interaction with a stranger in a Spanish Cafe leads to a dangerous series of events, and a weighty discovery that threatens everything Sloan ever knew about this world and his role in it. </p> <p><i>Club PK2</i> is written in the same Codex universe as the other stories but is a separate adventure with distinct characters. The voice is reminiscent of <i>Supernatural</i>. It follows a hardened cop named Tray sent undercover on special assignment to expose a dangerous underground fight club. The cop discovers much more than a bunch of thugs trying to make a buck, and he learns something about The Codex, and the demon's master plan in the process. </p> <p>P.S. </p> <p>The Codex ended up playing a pivotal role in the final story, <i>Sealed with Fire</i>. This epic final battle between The Crimson Pact and the demons pays tribute to the best stories and characters in the series. As you finish listening to this omnibus edition, I hope you'll be interested in learning how The Codex impacted the final fight. If that's the case, you'll want to pick up <i>The Crimson Pact</i>, volume five. </p>";
