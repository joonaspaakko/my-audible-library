window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Fifteen outstanding authors. Fifteen stories of augmented humanity!</b></p> <p>All I need is an edge! As long as humans have competed with each other (for food, profit, and love), people have looked for ways to get an edge on the competition - how to be better, faster, and smarter than the opposition.&nbsp;</p> <p>With better science and technology, many things are now possible, and there will be many more in the future! Gene splicing will augment your abilities. Implants will make you smarter. Cybernetic systems will make you stronger.</p> <p>Edited by Jamie Ibson and Chris Kennedy, <i>We Dare</i> is a collection of 15 all-new stories that explores the use of augmented humanity in the near future. From getting a new personality loaded with the skills you need for a mission to nanobots that keep you from being killed to creating an indestructible tank, anything is possible!</p> <p>But just because we can augment humanity doesn’t necessarily mean we should, and there are cautionary tales inside, as well. Along with the “good” that might be possible, there is also the potential for augmentation to be used for more...nefarious...ends. Will augmentation make better criminals? What happens when someone with implants has their mind taken over?&nbsp;One thing is certain, though. People will dare to augment themselves to get an edge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our authors dared to write these stories of augmented humanity. Will you now dare to listen to them?</p> <p>Inside, you’ll find:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Preface by Chris Kennedy</li> <li>\"Kade\" by Christopher Woods</li> <li>\"Taming the Beast\" by Kevin Steverson</li> <li>\"Tank\" by J.F.
