window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is the autumn of 1880, and Dr. John Watson has just returned from Afghanistan. Badly injured and desperate to forget a nightmarish expedition that left him doubting his sanity, Watson is close to destitution when he meets the extraordinary Sherlock Holmes, who is investigating a series of deaths in the Shadwell district of London.

Moreover, there are disturbing reports of creeping shadows that inspire dread in any who stray too close.&nbsp;</p> <p>Holmes deduces a connection between the deaths and a sinister drug lord who is seeking to expand his criminal empire.

Forces that can be summoned, if one is brave - or mad - enough to dare â€¦</p>";
