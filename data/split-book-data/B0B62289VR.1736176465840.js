window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains the complete Wolf of the North trilogy.</b></p> <p><i>Wolf of the North</i>, book 1</p> <p>It has been generations since the Northlands have seen a hero worthy of the title. Many have made the claim, but few have lived to defend it. Timid, weak, and bullied, Wulfric is as unlikely a candidate as there could be.</p> <p>A chance encounter with an ancient and mysterious object awakens a latent gift, and Wulfric's life changes course. Against a backdrop of war, tragedy, and an enemy whose hatred for him knows no bounds, Wulfric will be forged from a young boy into the Wolf of the North. This is his tale.</p> <p><i>Jorundyr's Path</i>, book 2</p> <p>Jorundyr's Path is walked only by the brave. It is survived only by the strong. As Wulfric pursues Adalhaid's Blood Debt, he soon learns that the path to revenge is never easy, and the desires of men and the will of gods rarely meet. Aethelman seeks answers to questions long ignored. Rodulf chases power and wealth.</p> <p>From the streets of Elzburg to the dry plains of Darvaros, Wulfric walks Jorundyr's Path and encounters a world larger than he could ever have dreamed of, filled with friends, enemies, and dangerâ€”the crucible from which heroes are forged.</p> <p><i>The Blood Debt</i>, book 3</p> <p>A blade fit for a hero. An army for a tyrant. A reckoning long awaited, and a tale reaching its end.</p>";
