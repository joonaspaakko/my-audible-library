She&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;becomes a suspect in&nbsp;the&nbsp;homicide investigation, and the Rubicon women are thrown into chaos. Beth&nbsp;thinks Lana should focus on recovery, but Lana has&nbsp;a better idea. She’ll pull on her wig,&nbsp;find the true murderer, protect her family, and prove she still has power.</p> <p>With Jack and&nbsp;Beth’s&nbsp;help, Lana uncovers a web of lies, family vendettas, and land disputes lurking beneath the&nbsp;surface&nbsp;of a community populated by folksy conservationists and wealthy ranchers. But as&nbsp;their amateur snooping advances into ever-more dangerous territory,&nbsp;the&nbsp;headstrong Rubicon women&nbsp;must learn to do the one thing they’ve always resisted: depend on each other.</p>";
