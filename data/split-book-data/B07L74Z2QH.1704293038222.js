window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>We just lost our place at the top of the food chain. Man is just meat. </b></p> <p>It is only when the bones of its prey are discovered in a remote Scottish glen that the majesty and power of one of nature’s most successful predators is truly revealed. As it strikes silently from the shadows and on nights shrouded in darkness, a small village falls under siege to a remarkable creature. For thousands of years mankind has had the upper hand but now - suddenly, violently, bloodily - the balance of power has shifted.&nbsp;</p> <p>When an isolated wildlife research centre launches an investigation, it is soon discovered that something out of place has made the Highlands its home and set its sights on the quiet village of Cannich. It will hunt, it will kill, and it won’t let anything get in its way. Thomas Walker, a renowned wildlife specialist and former big game hunter, finds himself confronted with his past and an animal the likes of which he had never wanted to face again. As its devastating rampage goes unchecked and threatens his home, the woman he loves and his very way of life, an older and much more human adversary seeks him out. How long will any of them survive the presence of the beast in their shadow?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>There are nearly 2,000 reported sightings of what have become known as mystery big cats across the UK every year. Some, such as the beasts of Bodmin and Dartmoor, have become infamous. Their origin and identity remain unknown. </i>Shadow Beast<i>, the new chiller from Luke Phillips, offers a terrifying and deadly explanation.</i></p>";
