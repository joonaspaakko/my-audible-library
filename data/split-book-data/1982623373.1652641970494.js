window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the third in the epic fantasy series,&nbsp;</b><b><i>War of the Archons</i></b><b>, the war of the gods continues to threaten all existence.</b></p> <p>As its neighbors muster for war, the city-state of Kantor clings desperately to neutrality. Suraan, the queen regent, is beset on all sides, her son Rahuul still too young to take the throne. As his elder sister and guardian, Adaaliâ€™s only purpose is to protect Rahuul from would-be usurpers. But dark forces are at play from within and without, and she must seek help from the most unlikely of places - or be consumed by the war of the gods that threatens to destroy the very fabric of her world.</p>";
