His Culture books combine breathtaking imagination with exceptional storytelling, and have secured his reputation as one of the most extraordinary and influential writers in the genre.</b><br> <br> The Culture - a utopian human-machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many expert Game Players, and one of the greatest is Jernau Morat Gurgeh. He is Master of every board, computer and strategy - he is The Player of Games.<br> <br> Bored with success, Gurgeh travels to the cruel and incredibly wealthy Empire of Azad to try their infamous game . . . a game so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh plays the game, and faces the challenge of his life - and very possibly his death.</p> <p><b> The Culture series:</b><br> <i>Consider Phlebas</i><br> <i>The Player of Games</i><br> <i>Use of Weapons</i><br> <i>Excession</i><br> <i>Inversions</i><br> <i>Look to Windward</i><br> <i>Matter</i><br> <i>Surface Detail</i><br> <i>The Hydrogen Sonata</i><br> <i>The State of the Art</i><br> <br> <b>Other books by Iain M.
