window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Joshua T. Calvert has a gift for making nail-biting science fiction that you can't put down. Get ready for some sleepless nights!\"—M. A. Rothman, USA Today bestselling author</p> <p>In Lake Maracaibo, in the northwestern part of Venezuela, a long-hidden extraterrestrial artifact underneath the ocean floor triggers a disaster. The United States military launches an expedition, sending a cutting-edge team of international researchers to the source of a magnetic instability that's destroying any electronics in the region.</p> <p>Inside the large artifact is a chamber that's large enough for the researchers to enter. After a shocking death, the scientists from the United States, Europe, and Russia realize that it is a teleportation device. But they soon face a fundamental question: Why do those who enter the chamber fall into a coma? Are they traveling to other places, or is it all just an illusion? Dream or reality, the other side of the teleporter turns out to be a hell that puts not only the team, but the entire project to the test—because they are not alone out there.</p>";
