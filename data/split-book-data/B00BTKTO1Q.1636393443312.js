window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ex-cop turned private investigator Robert Hoskins always enjoyed the stories his grandmother had told him as a child, stories of the Dryad that lived in the tree, the Faeries in the garden, and the magical world that was created in his imagination. He always enjoyed them; he just never thought that they were true. Robert's childhood world of magic becomes real when a chance encounter with a local casino mob boss introduces him to the world he was born into, the world that was hidden from him, the world of the Fae. But he's not easily convinced. </p> <p>From disbelief to acceptance, Robert encounters a variety of mythical beings. From Faeries and Norse legends to the Oracle at Delphi, from Mermaids to Werewolves to everything in between, Robert's world has definitely changed. While his path through that world appears chosen he soon learns that the beings that reside in the world of his grandmother's stories aren't that much different than those of the mortal world. Good and evil still battle one another and it's time to take sides. </p> <p>What should Robert do when the world around him stops making sense? When he has to find out from a Dwarf that his dog is descended from Fae hunting dogs. When he knows that corporations and even the mob don't run Vegas, it's the Fae. When the prettiest girls he meets are over 3,000 years old and some of them drink blood. And that stripper, is she really a Faery? Let's not even go there. What should Robert do when he learns that strength in his new world is measured in magic, and he doesn't have a clue how to wield it? </p> <p>Do Demons, Gods, Elves, and Faeries really exist? Are Vampires truly the children of Lilith? Robert didn't believe it at first either.... </p>";
