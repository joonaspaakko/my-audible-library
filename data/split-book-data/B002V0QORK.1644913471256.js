Mike Hammer for his biggest and most dangerous case yet. <p>In the midst of a Manhattan snowstorm, Hammer halts the violent robbery of a pair of college sweethearts who have stumbled onto a remarkable archeological find in the Valley of Elah: the perfectly preserved femur of what may have been the biblical giant Goliath. Hammer postpones his marriage to his faithful girl Friday, Velda, to fight a foe deadlier than the mobsters and KGB agents of his past: Islamic terrorists and Israeli extremists bent upon recovering the relic for their own agendas.</p> <p>Completed after Spillane's death by his frequent collaborator, Max Allan Collins, this thriller is as classic as Spillane's own <i>I, the Jury</i> and as contemporary as <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>.</p>";
