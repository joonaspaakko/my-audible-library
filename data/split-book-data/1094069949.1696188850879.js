window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It has been 16 years since the Day of Reckoning, when magic and witchcraft were outlawed throughout all of Eileanan. And though rumors say that she is dead, the Arch-Sorceress Meghan of the Beasts still lives. Traveling with her are the true heir to the throne and the red-haired warrior Iseult. Their fates are woven together in a quest to bring magic back to the land.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Eileanan nears its darkest hour, Meghan must gather rebel forces to move upon the city of Lucescere. There, the Rìgh lies near death, and his Queen, Maya the Ensorcellor, and her babe stand to inherit his power. To end Maya’s brutal reign and bring magic out of the shadows, what was broken must be brought together: twin sisters who have never met, three parts of an enchanted key, and the winged man with the powers of the lost Lodestar.</p>";
