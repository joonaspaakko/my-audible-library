But nothing about Toshack’s murder is normal. </p> <p>Toshack had struck a bargain with a vindictive entity, whose occult powers kept Toshack one step ahead of the law - until his luck ran out. Now, the team must find a 'suspect' who can bend space and time and alter memory itself.

Then they must hunt a terrifying supernatural force the only way they know how: using police methods, equipment, and tactics. But they must all learn the rules of this new game - and quickly. More than their lives will depend on it. </p> <p>Paul Cornell has written some of <i>Doctor Who</i>'s best-loved episodes for the BBC.
