Trained to hunt and kill vampires over 300 years ago, my training became essential once I became one of those monsters.</p> <p>The underbelly of the supernatural world has begun to bleed into the human world, and journalist Rachel Sambrook is asking too many dangerous questions. Unwittingly, she's revealed a conspiracy I had hoped would never become a reality: using vampire blood for human experiments.</p> <p>As I attempt to contain her, she's by my side, and the truth of just how deep the darkness goes is exposed.
