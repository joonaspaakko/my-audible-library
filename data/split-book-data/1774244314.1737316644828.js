window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Stranded, Loham Babar has spent the last 15 months living amongst humans.</b></p> <p>During the day, he’s a South Chicago high school janitor, slopping a mop around from nine o’clock to three o’clock, five days a week. At night, hiding out in an old boarded-up factory, he attends to his damaged interstellar spacecraft, making repairs and counting the days until he can return to his homeworld of Calunoth. All he needs to do is mind his own business and avoid any messy human dramas for just a few more weeks.</p> <p>But it is on one of those quiet nights when he hears them outside: the MP140s. Named for a police radio code for murder, these bangers are among the worst, most ruthless killers in the entire city. Peering down from the third floor window, Babar recognizes the quiet hermit boy below him, the one with the ugly facial scars, walking into a death trap. Little does Babar realize at the time that this scared, complicated, seventeen-year-old will be the key to saving the distant Realm of Dom Dynasty.</p>";
