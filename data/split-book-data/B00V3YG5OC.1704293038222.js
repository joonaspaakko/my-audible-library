So when two vampires try to kidnap the baby, it quickly turns into a fight to the death - Lex’s death, that is.</p> <p>She wakes up to two shocking discoveries: she has miraculously survived the fight, and baby Charlie is a “null”, gifted with the ability to weaken supernatural forces...and a target for creatures who want to control that power.
