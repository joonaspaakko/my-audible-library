But Micah writes his own legend in blood, and his righteous conquest will stop at nothing. When the gods choose sides, a legend will be etched upon the stars.<br> <br> <i>Game of Thrones</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Arabian Nights</i> in&nbsp;this blood-soaked epic fantasy inspired by The Crusades, featuring Lovecraftian gods, mischievous djinns, and astral magic.</p>";
