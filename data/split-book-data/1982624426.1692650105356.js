window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The launch of a gripping new supernatural terror trilogy by the acclaimed author of </b><b><i>Coldbrook</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Silence</i></b><b>, and the Alien-Predator Rage War trilogy </b></p> <p>There's an underground black market for arcane things. Akin to the trade in rhino horns or tiger bones, this network traffics in remains of gryphons, faeries, goblins, and other fantastic creatures.&nbsp;</p> <p>When her fiance Vince goes missing, Angela Gough, an American criminology student, discovers he was a part of this secretive trade. It's a big-money business-shadowy, brutal, and sometimes fatal. As the trail leads her deeper into London's dark side, she crosses paths with a crime lord whose life is dedicated to collecting such relics.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Angela discovers that some of these objects aren't as ancient as they seem. Some of them are fresh.</p>";
