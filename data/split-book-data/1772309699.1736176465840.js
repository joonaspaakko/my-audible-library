window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A warrior with a secret, a ruthless band of cutthroats, and a monster of ancient legend converge in this fantasy from the author of the Mountain Man series.</b></p> <p>It’s a time of war. After years of relentless battle, the tired nation of Sunja realizes its spine is close to breaking. Desperate for aid, the country’s king dispatches a company of soldiers to the north in a desperate plea for help from its neighbors. A Sunjan cavalier called Bloor has the unenviable task of leading the mission. His doomed and divided command will soon discover it’s not the war-torn northern wilderness—or the legions of hated Nordish soldiers—they need to be on guard against. A much more sinister threat awaits them, just out of sight of Sunja’s high walls, one that threatens to rip them all apart—and swallow them whole.</p> <p><i>The Troll Hunter</i> is a story of heroic fantasy from the bestselling author of the Breeds and Mountain Man series.</p>";
