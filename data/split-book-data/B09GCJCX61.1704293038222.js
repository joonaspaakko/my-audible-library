window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“I loved it.\"</b>—<b>Stephen King</b></p> <p><b>From Jason Rekulak, Edgar-nominated author of </b><b><i>The Impossible Fortress</i></b><b>, comes a wildly inventive spin on the classic horror story in </b><b><i>Hidden Pictures</i></b><b>, a supernatural thriller about a woman working as a nanny for a young boy with strange and disturbing secrets.</b></p> <p>Fresh out of rehab, Mallory Quinn takes a job as a babysitter for Ted and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy.</p> <p>Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body.</p> <p>Then, Teddy’s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures quickly evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old. Mallory begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force.</p> <p>Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher the images and save Teddy before it’s too late.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books.</b></p>";
