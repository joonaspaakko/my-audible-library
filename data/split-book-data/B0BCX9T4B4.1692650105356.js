window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A librarian with a mysterious past, a war hero with a secret, and the heist of a magic painting. </b><b><i>The Librarian of Crooked Lane</i></b><b> is an intriguing new fantasy from C.J. Archer, the </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author of the Glass and Steele series.</b></p> <p>Librarian Sylvia Ashe knows nothing about her past, having grown up without a father and a mother who refused to discuss him. When she stumbles upon a diary that suggests she's descended from magicians, she's skeptical. After all, magicians are special, and she's just an ordinary woman who loves books. She seeks answers from&nbsp;a member of&nbsp;the most prominent family of magicians, but she quickly learns that&nbsp;finding the truth won't be easy, especially when he turns out to be as artless as her, and more compelling and dangerous than books.</p> <p>War hero Gabe is gifted&nbsp;with wealth, a loving family, and an incredible amount of luck that saw him survive four harrowing years of a brutal war without injury. But not all injuries are visible. Burying himself in his work as a consultant for Scotland Yard, Gabe is going through the motions as he investigates the theft of a magician-made painting. But his life changes when he unwittingly gets Sylvia dismissed from her job and places her in danger.</p> <p>After securing her new employment in a library housing the world's greatest collection of books about magic, Gabe and Sylvia's lives become intwined as they&nbsp;work together to find both the painting and the truth about Sylvia's past&nbsp;before powerful people can stop them.&nbsp;</p> <p>But sometimes the past is better left buried?</p>";
