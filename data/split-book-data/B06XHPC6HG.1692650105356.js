window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A cursed druid, blackmailed by a faery queen to find a missing magic rock. Let's just hope they don't hack the druid off...for everyone's sake. </p> <p>Name's Colin McCool. Folks call me the Junkyard Druid. I hate that name. </p> <p>Despite my last name, I'm not \"cool\" like the other hunters in town. I don't run an occult bookstore, I've never owned a Harley, and I didn't inherit a family fortune passed down through generations of hunters before me. </p> <p>And I kind of have this curse on me that's messed up my life. </p> <p>So, things have gone to hell since I was cursed. I live in a junkyard, my mentor Finn is a heroin addict, I've got the Cold Iron Circle breathing down my neck, and the local Fae Queen Maeve is blackmailing me into doing her dirty work. </p> <p>Now I'm in way over my head trying to retrieve Maeve's stolen magic rock, all while helping my friend Belladonna solve a series of murders that may or may not involve the local werewolves. </p> <p>And did I mention that my girlfriend is a ghost? </p> <p>If I can just get the Faery Queen's tathlum back, and help Belladonna solve the murders... </p> <p>Then I just might live long enough to finish my first year of college. </p>";
