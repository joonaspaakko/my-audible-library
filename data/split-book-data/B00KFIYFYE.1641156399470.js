window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Will Innis and his daughter, Devlin, the loss was catastrophic. Every day for the past five years, they wonder where she is, if she is - Will's wife, Devlin's mother - because Rachael Innis vanished one night during an electrical storm on a lonely desert highway, and suspected of her death, Will took his daughter and fled. </p> <p>Now, Will and Devlin live under different names in another town, having carved out a new life for themselves as they struggle to maintain some semblance of a family. </p> <p>When, one night, a beautiful, hard-edged FBI agent appears on their doorstep, they fear the worst. But she hasn't come to arrest Will. \"I know you're innocent,\" she tells him, \"because Rachael wasn't the first...or the last.\" </p> <p>Desperate for answers, Will and Devlin embark on a terrifying journey that spans 4,000 miles from the desert southwest to the wilds of Alaska, heading unaware into the heart of a nightmare, because the truth is infinitely worse than they ever imagined.</p>";
