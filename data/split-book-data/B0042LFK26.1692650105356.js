window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>John Ajvide Lindqvist's vampire novel </b><b><i>Let Me In </i></b><b>was adapted into an award-winning Swedish movie and made into an American film and is now a TV show available to stream on Showtime!</b></p> <p>It is autumn 1981 when inconceivable horror comes to Blackeberg, a suburb in Sweden. The body of a teenager is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at long last—revenge for the bullying he endures at school, day after day.</p> <p>But the murder is not the most important thing on his mind. A new girl has moved in next door—a girl who has never seen a Rubik's Cube before, but who can solve it at once. There is something wrong with her, though, something odd. And she only comes out at night. . . .Sweeping top honors at film festivals all over the globe, <i>Let Me In</i> has received the same kind of spectacular raves that have been lavished on the book. American and Swedish listeners of vampire fiction will be thrilled! <br> <br> Following the success in Sweden, this movie was remade in 2010 starring Kodi Smit Mcpheem, Chloe Grace Moretz and Richard Jenkins changing its name from the Swedish <i>Let The Right One In.</i> The story has continued to reach new viewers in a London Musical and John Ajvide Lindqvist's book remains a vampire favorite among its listeners.</p>";
