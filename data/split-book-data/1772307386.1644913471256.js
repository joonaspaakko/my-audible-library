In an age of hobbyist’s drones and all sorts of flying gadgets, he wasn’t overly concerned until the large flying object moved much, much, closer.&nbsp;</p> <p>A storm was brewing and dark clouds blanketed the sky. Nervously, Scotty turned and tried to spot his house - somewhere off behind the dunes - but it would be 16 years before he’d see it again.</p>";
