window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On Christmas Day in 1893, every man, woman, and child in a remote gold-mining town disappeared, belongings forsaken, meals left to freeze in vacant cabins - and not a single bone was ever found. </p> <p>One hundred sixteen years later, two backcountry guides are hired by a history professor and his journalist daughter to lead them to the abandoned mining town so they can learn what happened. Recently, a similar party had also attempted to explore the town and was never heard from again. Now the area is believed to be haunted. This crew is about to discover, 20 miles from civilization with a blizzard bearing down, that they are not alone, and the past is very much alive. </p> <p>Revised edition: This edition of <i>Abandon</i> includes editorial revisions. </p>";
