window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jeff Grady had an amazing job. Little did he know, it would soon have him looking after thousands of uploaded minds.</b></p> <p>Earth is one step away from a nuclear war, and Paradigm Alpha’s solution to saving what they can of humanity is to upload their brains to The Doomsday System. But while most of the minds are being stored while they sleep, Jeff doesn’t have that option. As the only one who can be uploaded digitally and remain awake, he will be kept alive, as it were, in order to help humanity 10,000 years from now. But thanks to time compression in the system, it will only be a thousand years for him.</p> <p>Can Jeff mentally survive for that long? That's where The Doomsday System’s game might be able to help. However, there is one tiny little issue: The class the AIs gave him, Battlemage, which sounded so awesome at the time, is broken. He is a Battlemage who can’t seem to use magic as a normal Battlemage.</p> <p>Join Jeff as he explores this unknown world over the next thousand years.</p>";
