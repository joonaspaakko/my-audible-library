window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Surviving 60,000 years takes cunning and more than a little luck. But in the 21st century, Adam confronts new dangers - someone has found out what he is, a demon is after him, and he has run out of places to hide. Worst of all, he has had entirely too much to drink. </p> <p><i>Immortal</i> is a first person confessional penned by a man who is immortal, but not invincible. In an artful blending of sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, and humor, <i>Immortal</i> introduces us to a world with vampires, demons and other magical creatures, yet a world without actual magic. </p> <p>At the center of the book is Adam. </p> <p>Adam is a 60,000 year old man. He doesn't age or get sick, but is otherwise entirely capable of being killed. His survival has hinged on an innate ability to adapt, his wits, and a fairly large dollop of luck. He makes an excellent guide through history, when he's sober. </p>";
