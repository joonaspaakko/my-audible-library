The pay is crap, but the tips keep the lights on in her personal haunted mansion and her pantry stocked with ramen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Life is about as normal as it gets for an ex-necromancer hiding among humans - until the society that excommunicated Grier offers her a second chance at being more than ordinary. Too bad no one warned her the trouble with being extraordinary is it can get you killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
