It turns out living nightmares almost never appreciate a good joke. Together with a succubus who insists on constantly saving his life, Gabe desperately tries to survive a new reality that suddenly features demons, legends, and a giant locust named Dale - all of whom pretty much hate his guts. </p> <p>And when an ancient horror comes hunting for the spirit locked in his head, Gabe finds himself faced with the excruciating choice between death...or becoming some kind of <i>freaking</i> hero. </p> <p><i>Hero Forged</i> is the first book in the new series, <b>Ethereal Earth</b>, a modern fantasy adventure that challenges the natures of myth, humanity, and what it means to be the good guy.</p>";
