window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Who says a troll can’t be the hero?</i></b></p> <p>Chad Johnson built his following by being a troll. Online games, social media, you name it—he's there with a witty comeback. But when he goes too far during a televised stream, he's handed a punishment unlike any other.</p> <p>Instead of the usual ban or suspension, Chad's sentenced to 30 days of full immersion therapy in Isle of Mythos—a world of epic fantasy filled with dungeons and mythical creatures. The twist? He's forced to embody a forest troll, one of the most despised races in Mythos.</p> <p>At least the punishment fits the crime.</p> <p>Now, Chad's on a quest, slaying monsters and aiding his troll tribe. It's different, but not necessarily in a bad way, especially with a mischievous little imp as his sidekick. For the first time in his life, Chad's found something more than just trolling—he's found purpose.</p> <p>Rehabilitation? Call it what you want, but Chad's all in. Who knows? Maybe this troll is a hero.</p>";
