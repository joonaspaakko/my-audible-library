window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The action-packed alternate fantasy returns for a new generation, featuring fiction from number-one <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author George R. R. Martin, Michael Cassutt, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Lewis Shiner, and more - plus two completely new stories from Kevin Andrew Murphy and best-selling author Carrie Vaughn. </p> <p>Forty years after the Wild Card Virus' release, the World Health Organization decides it's time to take a delegation of Aces, Jokers, politicians, and journalists on a fact-finding mission to learn how other countries are dealing with the virus that reshaped humanity. Leading the team is Gregg Hartmann, a senator with presidential aspirations and a dangerous ace up his sleeve. Joining him is a menagerie of some of the series' best and most popular Wild Cards, including Dr. Tachyon; aces Peregrine and Golden Boy; and jokers Chrysalis, Troll, and Father Squid. </p> <p>From the jungles of Haiti and Peru to the tumultuous political climate of Egypt, from a monastery in Japan to the streets of the most glamorous cities of Europe, the Wild Cards are in for an eye-opening trip. While some are worshiped as actual gods, those possessing the most extreme mutations are treated with a contempt that's all too familiar to the delegates from Jokertown. New alliances will be formed, new enemies will be made, and some actions will fulfill centuries-old prophecies that make ripples throughout the future of the Wild Cards universe. </p> <p><b>Various Roles Read by a Full Cast of Narrators:</b> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Peregrine read by Kathleen Turner (\"Down by the Nile\") </li> <li>Chrysalis read by Selma Blair </li> <li>Sen.
