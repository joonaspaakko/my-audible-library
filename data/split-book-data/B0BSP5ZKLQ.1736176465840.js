window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER - REESE’S BOOK CLUB PICK</b></p> <p><b><i>Nothing brings a family together like a murder next door.</i></b></p> <p><b>“I just loved how intriguing the mystery is but also the dynamics between a grandmother, a mother, and a teenage daughter.\"\" —Reese Witherspoon</b></p> <p><b>Think: </b><b><i>Gilmore Girls</i></b><b>, but with murder.</b></p> <p>High-powered businesswoman Lana Rubicon has a lot to be proud of:<b> </b>her keen intelligence, impeccable taste, and the L.A. real estate empire she’s built. But when she finds herself trapped 300 miles north of the city, convalescing in a sleepy<b> </b>coastal town with her adult daughter Beth and teenage granddaughter Jack, Lana is stuck counting otters instead of square footage—and hoping that boredom won’t kill her before the cancer does.</p> <p>Then Jack—tiny in stature but fiercely independent—happens upon a dead body while kayaking. She quickly becomes a suspect in the homicide investigation, and the Rubicon women are thrown into chaos. Beth thinks Lana should focus on recovery, but Lana has a better idea. She’ll pull on her wig, find the true murderer, protect her family, and prove she still has power.</p> <p>With Jack and Beth’s help, Lana uncovers a web of lies, family vendettas, and land disputes lurking beneath the surface of a community populated by folksy conservationists and wealthy ranchers. But as their amateur snooping advances into ever-more dangerous territory, the headstrong Rubicon women must learn to do the one thing they’ve always resisted: depend on each other.</p>";
