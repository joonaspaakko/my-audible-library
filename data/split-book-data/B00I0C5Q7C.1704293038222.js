window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Savannah is considered a Southern treasure, a city of beauty with a rich, colorful past. Some might even call it magical.... </p> <p>To the uninitiated, Savannah shows only her bright face and genteel manner. Those who know her well, though, can see beyond her colonial trappings and small-city charm to a world where witchcraft is respected, Hoodoo is feared, and spirits linger. Mercy Taylor is all too familiar with the supernatural side of Savannah, being a member of the most powerful family of witches in the South. </p> <p>Despite being powerless herself, of course. </p> <p>Having grown up without magic of her own, in the shadow of her talented and charismatic twin sister, Mercy has always thought herself content. But when a series of mishaps - culminating in the death of the Taylor matriarch - leaves a vacuum in the mystical underpinnings of Savannah, she finds herself thrust into a mystery that could shake her family apart...and unleash a darkness the line of Taylor witches has been keeping at bay for generations. </p> <p>In <i>The Line</i>, the first book of the Witching Savannah series, J. D. Horn weaves magic, romance, and betrayal into a captivating Southern Gothic fantasy with a contemporary flair.</p>";
