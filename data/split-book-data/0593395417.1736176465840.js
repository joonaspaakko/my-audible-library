window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>Amatka </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Jagannath </i></b><b>-</b> <b>a fantastical tour de force about friendship, interdimensional theater, and a magical place where no one ages, except the young</b></p> <p>In a world just parallel to ours exists a mystical realm known only as the Gardens. It’s a place where feasts never end, games of croquet have devastating consequences, and teenagers are punished for growing up. For a select group of masters, it’s a decadent paradise where time stands still. But for those who serve them, it’s a slow torture where their lives can be ended in a blink. In a bid to escape before their youth betrays them, Dora and Thistle - best friends and confidants - set out on a remarkable journey through time and space. Traveling between their world and ours, they hunt for the one person who can grant them freedom. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious traveler who trades in favors and never forgets debts, a crossroads at the center of the universe, our own world on the brink of war, and a traveling troupe of actors with the ability to unlock the fabric of reality.</p> <p>Endlessly inventive, <i>The Memory Theater </i>takes us to a wondrous place where destiny has yet to be written, life is a performance, and magic can erupt at any moment. It is Karin Tidbeck’s most engrossing and irresistible tale yet.</p>";
