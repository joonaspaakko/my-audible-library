Something scary scratching at your window in the night? Then, I've got just the charm for you.</p> <p>Mostly, though, I find things. Lost treasures, missing loved ones...if you need something found, I'm your guy.</p> <p>So, when a grieving father hired me to track down a family heirloom stolen by a sticky-fingered hobgoblin, I was happy to help.</p> <p>No one was supposed to wind up dead. Especially not me. But they made a mistake when they put a bullet in my stomach and left me for the worms. They didn't bury me deep enough....</p> <p><b>If you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Shayne Silvers, M.D. Massey, or Orlando A. Sanchez, then you'll love taking a trip to the sleepy town of Lost Falls, where not everything is as it seems.</b></p>";
