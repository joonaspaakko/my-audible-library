In this tale of passion and obsession, Diana Bishop, a young scholar and a descendant of witches, discovers a long-lost and enchanted alchemical manuscript,&nbsp;Ashmole 782, deep in Oxford's Bodleian Library. Its reappearance summons a fantastical underworld, which she navigates with her leading man, vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont.</p> <p>Harkness has created a universe to rival those of Anne Rice, Diana Gabaldon, and Elizabeth Kostova, and she adds a scholar's depth to this riveting tale of magic and suspense. The story continues in book two,&nbsp;<i>Shadow of Night</i>, book three,&nbsp;<i>The Book of Life</i>, and the fourth in the series,&nbsp;<i>Time’s Convert</i>.</p>";
