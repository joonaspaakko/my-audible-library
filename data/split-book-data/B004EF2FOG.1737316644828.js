window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The novels of Iain M. Banks have forever changed the face of modern science fiction. His Culture books combine breathtaking imagination with exceptional storytelling, and have secured his reputation as one of the most extraordinary and influential writers in the genre.</b><br> <br> The Culture - a utopian human-machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many expert Game Players, and one of the greatest is Jernau Morat Gurgeh. He is Master of every board, computer and strategy - he is The Player of Games.<br> <br> Bored with success, Gurgeh travels to the cruel and incredibly wealthy Empire of Azad to try their infamous game . . . a game so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh plays the game, and faces the challenge of his life - and very possibly his death.</p> <p><b> The Culture series:</b><br> <i>Consider Phlebas</i><br> <i>The Player of Games</i><br> <i>Use of Weapons</i><br> <i>Excession</i><br> <i>Inversions</i><br> <i>Look to Windward</i><br> <i>Matter</i><br> <i>Surface Detail</i><br> <i>The Hydrogen Sonata</i><br> <i>The State of the Art</i><br> <br> <b>Other books by Iain M.
