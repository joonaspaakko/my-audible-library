window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Listed number one in women's fantasy fiction in Kindle.</b></p> <p>One day, I’m married, living in Seattle, and magic isn’t real. The next, I’m divorced and living in the guest room of my ex’s hotter-than-sin cousin’s place in Savannah and talking to an animated skeleton named Robert.</p> <p>I have to admit, Robert isn’t my worst date. At 41, I didn’t think I’d be starting over. But I’ll be damned if my ex thinks I’m down and out because he pulled a fast one on me.</p> <p>When a job comes my way that offers me a chance to use my childhood training in the shadow world, I take it. I need the money more than I care about my sanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s dangerous. I have to embrace the magic and dark of my past. And I need Advil to keep me going.&nbsp;</p> <p>But those who’d hold me back better sit up and take notice because a new woman is in town, and she’s not about to be counted out by anyone. Even if she does groan when she rolls out of bed in the morning.</p> <p><b>A paranormal women's fiction with a bit of class and a lot of sass for anyone who feels like age is just a number!</b></p>";
