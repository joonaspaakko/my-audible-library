window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audible number-one best sellers Rhett C. Bruno and Jaime Castle return with a relentless sci-fi adventure that asks: What if? </b></p> <p>The year is 1961. The Cold War is in full swing and the space race is on. Russia aims to send humanity to space. But what if space comes to humanity instead? Yuri Gagarin’s epic flight into space is disrupted when an alien Mothership jumps into orbit, causing a cosmic car crash that defies all odds.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything changes. The US and USSR must quickly put aside their differences. In exchange for the Earth’s help in the rebuilding of their Mothership, the mysterious aliens, the Vulbathi, offer promises of technology beyond humanity's wildest dreams. All the while, the world asks whether the Vulbathi are saviors or conquerors.&nbsp;</p> <p>When an alien tech counterfeiter's mistake sets off a chain reaction, the fragile peace is threatened. Connor McCoy didn't mean to upset Earth's new intergalactic neighbors. He only wanted to make some cash.</p> <p>Now, Connor is the only person who can stop the doomsday clock from striking midnight. That is if his estranged brother, an agent in the new Department of Alien Relations, doesn't stop him first.</p> <p>If you're a fan of <i>District 9</i>, <i>The Expanse</i>, Destiny's Crucible, or Andy Weir's <i>Artemis</i>, you'll love this alternate history romp across Earth and space, post alien contact.&nbsp;</p>";
