window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For those who reside in the outer regions of Aleria, the day of bestowal is what determines their destiny. </p> <p>It is the holy day of the Goddess. The day that allows those of age to step forward and receive their blessing, to embark on the path that she has chosen for them. To receive their Classification, which dictates their strength and ability. For those people, the holy day of bestowal represents fate itself. </p> <p>For Dante, it represents salvation. </p> <p>Years have past since he found himself abandoned without memories: years of hunger, ostracization, and solitude on the streets of Alazel without any hope of reprieve; of entrapment at the hands of the creatures that roamed the wilds beyond the city walls that made leaving impossible. </p> <p>Now, there is a chance for everything to change. </p> <p>In a cruel world where power could be gained through slaughter, strength meant everything. For Dante, that meant that the last his hopes lay in the Goddess' blessing. A combat Classification would be a lifeline, a way for him to escape the hell he had been living in. Anything else would only mean death. </p> <p>This is a fantasy story that is heavily influence by LitRPG elements, which include: classes, status screens, skills, leveling, and a form of experience gain, among other things.</p>";
