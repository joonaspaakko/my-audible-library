window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>At the end of the world, who will survive? </b></p> <p>The year is 2061, and the planet is dying. Cataclysmic solar storms have forced leaders from around the world to finally put aside their differences and agree on one thing-to jump ship. The human race is headed to Mars.</p> <p>Dr. Sophie Winston is hired by New Tech Corporation to test a biosphere deep within the heart of Cheyenne Mountain; a mission she believes will help prepare the company for the three-year flight to the red planet. But, just days into the assignment, things start to go wrong. When the blast doors hiss open, Winston's team finds a changed world outside. Humans are gone, vanished without a trace, and they aren't the only thing missing. The planet's water has disappeared, too.</p> <p>As the team explores their surroundings, they find thousands of luminous blue orbs lining the streets. It isn't until they uncover what's inside that they realize the nightmare that lies ahead.</p>";
