window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains the complete Mars trilogy.</b></p> <p><i>Book 1</i></p> <p>NASA finally made it. The very first human has just set foot on the surface of our neighbor planet. This is the start of a long research expedition that sent four scientists into space. But the four astronauts of the NASA crew are not the only ones with this destination. The privately financed \"Mars for Everyone\" initiative has also targeted the Red Planet. Twenty men and women have been selected to live there and establish the first extraterrestrial settlement. </p> <p>No one anticipates the impending catastrophe that threatens their very existence, not to mention the daily hurdles that an extended stay on an alien planet sets before them. On Mars, a struggle begins for limited resources, human cooperation, and just plain survival.</p> <p><i>Book 2</i></p> <p>A woman presumed dead fights her way through the hostile deserts of Mars. With her help, the NASA astronauts orphaned on the Red Planet hope to be able to solve their very worst problem. But their hopes are shattered when an unexpected menace arises and threatens to destroy everything the remnant of humanity has built on the planet. They need a miracle - or a ghost from the past whose true intentions are unknown.</p> <p><i>Book 3</i></p> <p>Does the secret of Mars lurk beneath the surface of its south pole? A lone astronaut searches for clues about the earlier inhabitants of the Red Planet. Meanwhile, Rick Summers, having assumed the office of Mars City's Administrator by deceit and manipulation, tries to unify the people on Mars with the weapons under his control. Then, Summers stumbles upon so powerful an evil that even he has no means to overcome it.</p>";
