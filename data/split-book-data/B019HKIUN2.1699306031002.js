window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jack Bloodfist fixes things. That's what his card says, anyway.... </p> <p>When the orcs and goblins of Summervale, Virginia, need something done, they call Jack. He's the one who convinces the local PD to ignore any tribal violence. The guy who makes sure the goblins aren't evicted whenever they do something decidedly goblin. </p> <p>He also does the little things that no one else is willing to do. Like handing keys over whenever a prodigal son returns, or identifying the body of said prodigal. </p> <p>Then there's the occasional murderous paladin and his vengeful god to deal with. </p> <p>All in a day's work. </p>";
