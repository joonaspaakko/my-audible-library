Here, on a barren world of underground caverns built around a core of molten lava, the lesser races—humans, elves, and dwarves—seem to have all died off. Here, too, what may well be the last remnants of the once powerful Sartan still struggle to survive. For Haplo and Alfred—enemies by heritage, traveling companions by necessity—Abarrach may reveal more than either dares to discover about the history of Sartan... and the future of all their descendants.</p> <p><b>*Includes a downloadable PDF of maps and sheet music for \"Death Masque\" from the book</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
