But FBI consultant Dr. Jeffrey Ailes' discovery of an old magic magazine will turn Jessica's world upside down.

Thrust into the media spotlight, with time ticking away until the next crime, can Jessica confront her past to stop a depraved killer? If she can't, she may become his next victim.</p>";
