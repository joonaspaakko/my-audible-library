window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pulitzer Prize, Fiction, 2019</b></p> <p><b>A monumental novel about reimagining our place in the living world, by one of our most \"prodigiously talented\" novelists (</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p><i>The Overstory</i> unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fable that range from antebellum New York to the late 20th-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond.</p> <p>An air force loadmaster in the Vietnam War is shot out of the sky, then saved by falling into a banyan. An artist inherits 100 years of photographic portraits, all of the same doomed American chestnut. A hard-partying undergraduate in the late 1980s electrocutes herself, dies, and is sent back into life by creatures of air and light. A hearing- and speech-impaired scientist discovers that trees are communicating with one another.</p> <p>These and five other strangers, each summoned in different ways by trees, are brought together in a last and violent stand to save the continent's few remaining acres of virgin forest. There is a world alongside ours - vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.</p>";
