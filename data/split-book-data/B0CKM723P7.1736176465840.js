window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joey Morales was the last recruit of the government's full black operation, the Orphan Program. Trained to be an assassin until she washed out, she was rescued by Evan Smoak, the former agent known as Orphan X. Now Joey, a world-class hacker, starts training for one of her biggest challenges yet: having a normal life.<br> <br> Still a teenager, she discovers she loves music as much as hacking, if not more so. But as she carves out a space for herself, the one thing missing is a family to support her endeavors. When a major recital comes up, she asks her rescuer turned adopted uncle, Evan, to recruit his various friends into another operation—attending her performance. And while Evan doesn’t understand why she wants them there, he won’t let her be disappointed—no matter what.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books.</b></p>";
