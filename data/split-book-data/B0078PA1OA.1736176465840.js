window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, Distinguished Achievement in Production, 2013</b></p> <p><b>Audie Award, Multi-voiced Performance, 2013</b></p> <p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Classic, 2013</b></p> <p>Because of the widespread awareness of the story of the evil Transylvanian count and the success of numerous film adaptations that have been created over the years, the modern audience hasn't had a chance to truly appreciate the unknowing dread that readers would have felt when reading Bram Stoker's original 1897 manuscript. Most modern productions employ campiness or sound effects to try to bring back that gothic tension, but we've tried something different. By returning to Stoker's original storytelling structure - a series of letters and journal entries voiced by Jonathan Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and other characters - with an all-star cast of narrators, we've sought to recapture its originally intended horror and power.</p> <p>This production of <i>Dracula</i> is presented by what is possibly the best assemblage of narrating talent ever for one audiobook: Emmy Award nominees Alan Cumming and Tim Curry plus an all-star cast of Audie award-winners Simon Vance (The Millenium Trilogy), Katherine Kellgren (<i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>), Susan Duerden (<i>The Tiger’s Wife</i>), John Lee (<i>Supergods</i>) and customer favorites Graeme Malcolm (<i>Skippy Dies</i>), Steven Crossley (The Oxford Time Travel series), Simon Prebble (The Baroque Cycle), James Adams (<i>Letters to a Young Contrarian</i>), Nicola Barber (<i>The Rose Garden</i>), Victor Villar-Hauser (<i>Fun Inc.</i>), and Marc Vietor (<i>1Q84</i>). These stellar narrators have been cast as follows:</p> <p>Alan Cumming as Dr. Seward<br> Simon Vance as Jonathan Harker<br> Katy Kellgren as Mina Murray/Harker<br> Susan Duerden as Lucy Westenra<br> Tim Curry as Van Helsing<br> Graeme Malcolm as Dailygraph correspondent<br> Steven Crossley as Zookeeper’s account and reporter<br> Simon Prebble as Varna<br> James Adams as Patrick Hennessey<br> Nicola Barber as Sister Agatha<br> Victor Villar-Hauser as Arthur Holmwood<br> Marc Vietor as Quincey Morris<br> John Lee as Introductory paragraph, various letters</p>";
