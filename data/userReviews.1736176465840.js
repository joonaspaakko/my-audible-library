It all felt like it took place within a few days... Almost every episode (as they called them) was cut short. Like something happens and it's immediately over. Story was, if not predictable, definitely nothing too new. Just like all those tv-shows, different but not that different. </p>","title":"The pacing is too fast"},{"asin":"B0CYHXRQXL","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"2"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"2"},{"name":"Story","stars":"2"}],"summary":"<p> From beginning to the end it keeps jumping between multiple people or groups of people, which pretty much kills a book for me personally... Not just that, but from beginning to the end it seems to kind of randomly sprinkle in their back stories right until the very end, which I thought was weird and too little too late.... Like the book was getting ready to wrap it up or at least it was starting to come together and perhaps we were about to get some answer and it suddenly jumps into a back story. Barely anything connected and we learned next to nothing. I feel like hearing each of their back stories way earlier or even in chronological order, I would've been way happier with the book. In fact if we had no idea about the underground city right up until the end and the book slammed us with it right at the very end it... That would've been something. Now nothing was resolved and the entire journey felt pointless.<br><br>The narrator was decent. Not Good, but okay... I'm pretty sure it was recorded inside a plastic barrel. Character voices were all over the place, but perhaps not to the point of being too distracting. I believe the first character the book starts with sounded so terrible that I was thinking about stopping, but then the voice mostly normalized for the rest of the book at some point. </p>","title":"Has too many flaws...

It starts out quite fun but the it starts dragging in the middle.<br><br>There were some aspects that felt a bit forced. Like how the reader along with the MC is meant to kinda see the villain as a tragic character that is misunderstood or something, but he has also some things that I felt should've been too much for the MC to fall for him.<br><br>I felt the story meandered a lot in the middle and then WHACKS you with the ending that was at the same time very gripping and interesting... Though right after this shocking reveal it kinda undoes everything and then it just kind of ends.<br><br>There were elements that felt very anime to me and then the storyline felt very similar to a bunch of anime/manga, or at least the core concept. Two that come to mind specifically are \"Black Healer\" and \"I'm the Villainess, So I'm Taming the Final Boss\". Except that both are isekai stories. So just to be clear, this book has no LitRPG elements. Also I should say the anime influences (if any) didn't really stand out aside from the story feeling a bit familiar. </p>","title":"Inspired by anime/manga?"},{"asin":"B08PZG314J","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"2"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"3"},{"name":"Story","stars":"2"}],"summary":"<p> I feel like I would've enjoyed this way more when I was like 15 or something, but as a 32 year old man, I couldn't look past all the angsty unprovoked anger bursts and lost interest like a hundred times but powered through it. I didn't like the protagonist at all and I think that ruined the book for me. What his stepfather did was revealed about 7 hours in and after that I felt that I understood the protagonist and his anger issues a bit better, but I had already been checked out after the first hour, so it was too little too late. <br> <br>If the first 7 hours was compressed into 1 hour or 2 hours max and/or if the protagonist's motivation and source of anger was revealed at the beginning, I probably would've loved the it... <br> <br>That said I am somewhat curious if the second book will be better, now that character building is pretty much done. It really felt a lot like the prequel book that is released after a series gets popular. For the first book in the series it seemed a bit too jumbled and boring. </p>","title":"I could've skipped it..."},{"asin":"B07TLF1JRL","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"3"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"4"},{"name":"Story","stars":"2"}],"summary":"<p> I would say the book is a lot like the first few seasons of the tv-show Supernatural… If you change the two pretty boys with one big redneck. Also, the tone of the book is generally a bit lighter, though not as funny as the summary might suggest. As a more general description, I’d describe it as a supernatural monster hunting romp of a book. <br> <br>The book is overall very episodic, in that every chapter is its own contained story (more or less), to make that tv-show comparison again. It’s basically multiple short stories in the same universe and same characters with a little bit of overlap here and there. <br> <br>I gotta say this 3 book combo was a bit of a chore to finish like 2/3rds in or maybe even a bit sooner and I’d say it had a lot to do with the episodic style, which I guess sort of made it so that there weren’t any stakes because he always comes on top, because you can’t kill the main character, and it sort of resets every time you get to a new chapter: a new day, new monsters and some continuity sprinkled in here and there. <br> <br>There is an overarching storyline that emerges at some point… but even that is maybe a little flimsy. It’s exactly the same as the overarching thread in some crime/drama tv-shows. One example that comes to mind is the tv-show The Mentalist, where he was after the person who killed his family, but it was really nothing more than the justification for the career change and the show would on occasion dangle that carrot in front of the viewer being like “Yea, his wife’s killer is back… Continuity and intrigue… Nailed it!”. Actually, now that I made that comparison I realized the same applies to the first few seasons of Supernatural as well. <br> <br>Anyways, one important thing to note is that this was indeed 3 books in one package. You could argue that some books are this long and they’re amazing, but this series works much better if you treat it like 3 separate books. I absolutely recommend you take take a break after each book and listen to something else in between to avoid it becoming a bit stale and boring and to keep it an interesting story that you can jump into every now and then. Unfortunately the chapters don’t tell you where each book starts. I think they do say it in the audio though. That said, you can pretty much stop listening after any chapter and the next chapter will continue with something completely different. There are maybe a few exceptions to that, but I would say you it doesn’t matter. It might also make sense to listen to it like similar to how you’d watch a weekly tv-show or maybe listen to a few chapters and then take a break. <br> </p>","title":"Don’t binge it and you’ll thank me later"},{"asin":"1541449967","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"4"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"4"},{"name":"Story","stars":"3"}],"summary":"<p> I loved the murder mystery setting with a supernatural/scifi twist concept. The flow was really good and it was easy to follow. <br> <br>My only issue with the book is that the main character ends up being less helpful than I would've thought based how much I was told he is some kind of super duper agent-or-whatever. The book spent so much time telling me how awesome he is but most of his abilities weren't put to any use. He could've just as well been a normal dude. While the setting is very that traditional mansion murder mystery thing, don't go into it expecting a Sherlock Holmes style detective story. <br> <br>So while I was really enjoying the listen, the ending was a little bit of a let down given the premise. That said, I was into it from the beginning to the end. <br> <br>P.S. I think I've listened to 5 of Simon R. Green's books and it seems like his thing is to tell the story from the main character's perspective and have him constantly remind the reader how amazing he is. </p>","title":"I enjoyed it, but..."},{"asin":"B071LM7BTH","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"4"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"4"},{"name":"Story","stars":"4"}],"summary":"<p> This piqued my interest because the description made me think of the late 90's tv show Early Edition, where a man receives tomorrow's newspaper every morning and then he tries to save people based on the articles. <br> <br>The basic premise of this books seems almost identical, but in this book, the main character sees in the future and while it's implied he's been going out there saving random people on the streets, sort of like in the tv show, the story focuses on a bigger threat for the most part. <br> <br>I've listened to some books where it took me somewhere around 5-9 hours to get interested in it, but this had me locked in since the beginning. I think it's because I liked the premise and it delivered on that almost immediately. <br> <br>The pacing was a bit weird sometimes... It wrapped some things up really fast like there wasn't enough time to finish the sentence and then at times it was a bit sluggish. It almost seemed like it could've been a few books, but it was condensed into one. <br> <br>I really loved the book and I'm definitely going to give it a second listen at some point. <br> <br>As a side note... One of the stories in \"The Immortal Chronicles, Book 3\", had Corrigan's father or grandfather in it, I'm not exactly sure... it's been a while since I listened to that. </p>","title":"I want more.
