Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the facts that (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces; (2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations; and (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission.

Thallian has been on the lam for the last 15 years. He's a wanted war criminal whose entire family has been hunted down and murdered for their role in the galaxywide genocide of the Templars. His name is the first on Raena's list, as he's the one who enslaved her, made her his assassin, and ultimately put her in a tomb.

But then his investigation uncovers something far more serious than mass slaughter---a covert plot by an enigmatic entity who seeks nothing less than total control of the Glitter Band. Before long, the Panoply detectives are fighting against something worse than tyranny, in a struggle that will lead to more devastation and more death.

Each \"past\" is effectively an alternate world, identical to ours but only up to the date on which we access it. And a given \"past\" can be reached only once.

It's been in operation for most of a decade, but it's no secret on either side of time. A small city has grown up around it to entertain visitors from our time, and many locals earn a good living catering to them. But like all such operations, it has a shelf life; as the \"natives\" become more sophisticated, their version of the \"past\" grows less attractive as a destination. </p> <p>Jesse Cullum is a native. And he knows the passageway will be closing soon.

Now Whitley Strieber, author of the #1 best seller <i>Communion</i>, which detailed his own close encounters, returns with <i>The Grays</i>, a mind-bending journey behind the curtain of secrecy that surrounds the subject of aliens. This audiobook will make you think deeply, not only about the mystery of who the Grays are, but who exactly we are. <p>Meet the Three Thieves: a group of Grays assigned to duty in a small Kentucky town. They've been occupying this town for decades, abducting its residents and manipulating bloodlines in an attempt to create an ultra-intelligent human being. Nine-year-old Conner Callahan will face the ultimate terror as he struggles to understand who he has been bred to be and what he must do to save humanity.</p> <p>Meet Colonel Michael Wilkes, a government official who has monitored the Grays' presence for years. He's done everything in his power to keep the secret of the Grays from reaching the public, but when the Grays begin to reveal themselves, Wilkes' fear of ultimate occupation forces him to set in motion a sinister plan to ensure the survival of humanity. But at what cost?</p> <p>The fate of the human race lies in one woman, Lauren Glass. Her father was the only man to communicate with the Grays. His untimely death leaves Lauren the unique ability to communicate with the last remaining captive Gray, known as A for Adam, and she may be the only one to truly unravel the Grays' ultimate plan.</p>","title":"The Grays","titleShort":"The Grays"},{"added":423,"asin":"B07DJVDLL9","authors":[{"name":"Robert Jackson Bennett","url":"B00CXLKR2K"}],"blurb":"Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. </p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. </p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life.

But they do get grouchy in middle age. The beloved King Ik is dead, and there was barely time to check his pulse before the royal throne was supporting the suspiciously shapely backside of an impostor pretending to be Ik's beautiful, long-lost daughter. With the land's heroic hunks busy drooling all over themselves, there's only one man left who can save the kingdom of Jenair. His name is Dungar Loloth, a rural blacksmith turned innkeeper, a surly hermit, and an all-around nobody oozing toward middle age, compensating for a lack of height, looks, charm, and tact with guts and an attitude. Normally politics is the least of his concerns, but after everyone in the neighboring kingdom of Farrawee comes down with a severe case of being dead, Dungar learns that the masquerading princess not only is behind the carnage but also has similar plans for his own hometown. Together with the only person senseless enough to tag along, an eccentric and arguably insane hobo named Jimminy, he journeys out into the world he's so pointedly tried to avoid as the only hope of defeating the most powerful person in it. That is, if he can survive the pirates, cultists, radical Amazonians, and assorted other dangers lying in wait along the way. Logan J. Hunder's hilarious debut blows up the fantasy genre with its wry juxtaposition of the fantastic and the mundane, proving that the best and brightest heroes aren't always the best for the job. </p>","title":"Witches Be Crazy","titleShort":"Witches Be Crazy"},{"added":387,"asin":"1982623292","authors":[{"name":"R.

At first, he couldn’t be happier...until dead people rear their grisly heads and grasping hands, pulling him back into his old job of ghost hunting.</p> <p><i>The Academy</i>: Brian’s exhaustion is deeper than ever before. But when he finds out his cousin Mitchell, the principal of the academy, is running into some ghostly trouble, he races against time to stop them.</p>","title":"Moving In Series Box Set Books 1 - 6: Supernatural Horror with Scary Ghosts and Haunted Houses","titleShort":"Moving In Series Box Set Books 1 - 6"},{"added":381,"asin":"B077V4855B","authors":[{"name":"Dean Koontz","url":"B000APG4T6"}],"blurb":"Every city has its secrets.

The six members he’s gathered know a little of the otherworldly - each has honed a psychic talent of their own. </p> <p>Jackson Crow, part English, part Cheyenne, heads the group. Haunted by his experience with an ancestral ghost who saved his life as a child, and the recent murders of two previous teammates, Jackson can’t tell if Adam’s demoted him or given him an extraordinary opportunity. Despite his link to the realm of spirits, he’s well aware that the living commit the most heinous crimes, with spiritualist charlatans existing merely to fool and seduce the unwary. </p> <p>To counterbalance Jackson’s careful skepticism, Adam Harrison has paired him with Angela Hawkins, a young woman who learned the painful lesson of loss at an early age. A police officer utilizing her paranormal intuition in Virginia, she already has her hands full. But Adam’s call to New Orleans is strong. </p> <p>The case: In a historic mansion in New Orleans’ French Quarter, a senator’s wife falls to her death from a balcony. Most think she jumped, distraught over the loss of her young son. Some say she was pushed. And yet others believe she was beckoned by the ghostly spirits that inhabit the house - once the site of a serial killer’s grisly work. Whether supernatural or all too human, crimes of passion, greed, and desire will cast the pair into danger of losing their lives... and their immortal souls. </p>","title":"Phantom Evil","titleShort":"Phantom Evil"},{"added":377,"asin":"B002VACGL8","authors":[{"name":"Michael Connelly","url":"B000APETH0"}],"blurb":"For maverick LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch, the body in the drainpipe at Mulholland Dam is more than another anonymous statistic.

It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. </b></p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, <i>The Sandman </i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel. </p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. </p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.</p>","title":"The Sandman","titleShort":"The Sandman"},{"added":368,"asin":"1543627412","authors":[{"name":"Dean Koontz","url":"B000APG4T6"}],"blurb":"Woody Bookman hasn’t spoken a word in his eleven years of life.

In this dark urban fantasy from acclaimed author Victoria Schwab, a young woman and a young man must choose whether to become heroes or villains - and friends or enemies - with the future of their home at stake. The first of two books, <i>This Savage Song</i> is a must-have for fans of Holly Black, Maggie Stiefvater, and Laini Taylor. </p> <p>Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided city - a city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father, who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human, as good-hearted as his own father, to play a bigger role in protecting the innocent - but he's one of the monsters. One who can steal a soul with a simple strain of music. </p> <p>When the chance arises to keep an eye on Kate, who's just been kicked out of her sixth boarding school and returned home, August jumps at it. But Kate discovers August's secret, and after a failed assassination attempt the pair must flee for their lives. </p> <p>In <i>This Savage Song</i>, Victoria Schwab creates a gritty, seething metropolis, one worthy of being compared to Gotham and to the four versions of London in her critically acclaimed fantasy for adults, <i>A Darker Shade of Magic</i>.

Lying low in the bayou, this once-magnificent fire breather has been reduced to lighting Marlboros with nose sparks, swilling Absolut in a <i>Flashdance </i>T-shirt, and binging Netflix in a fishing shack. For centuries, he struck fear in hearts far and wide as Wyvern, Lord Highfire of the Highfire Eyrie - now he goes by Vern. However...he has survived, unlike the rest. He is the last of his kind, the last dragon. Still, no amount of vodka can drown the loneliness in his molten core. Vern’s glory days are long gone. Or are they?</p> <p>A canny Cajun swamp rat, young Everett “Squib” Moreau does what he can to survive, trying not to break the heart of his saintly single mother. He’s finally decided to work for a shady smuggler - but on his first night, he witnesses his boss murdered by a crooked constable. </p> <p>Regence Hooke is not just a dirty cop, he’s a despicable human being - who happens to want Squib’s momma in the worst way.

He can act as his go-between (a.k.a. familiar) - fetch his vodka, keep him company, etc. - in exchange for protection from Hooke. Soon the three of them are careening headlong toward a combustible confrontation. There’s about to be a fiery reckoning, in which either dragons finally go extinct - or Vern’s glory days are back.</p> <p>A triumphant return to the genre-bending fantasy that Eoin Colfer is so well known for, <i>Highfire </i>is an effortlessly clever and relentlessly funny tour de force of comedy and action.</p>","title":"Highfire: A Novel","titleShort":"Highfire"},{"added":355,"asin":"B002V0PP0M","authors":[{"name":"Dean Koontz","url":"B000APG4T6"}],"blurb":"They found the town silent, apparently abandoned.

After one of these shady gigs and after being a witness to a crime gone horribly wrong, Tony discovers that people around him are dying, for reasons that make no sense...and which just may implicate him.</p> <p>Tony is running out of time: to solve the mystery of these deaths, to keep others from dying, and to keep himself from being a victim of what looks like murder, by other means.</p>","title":"Murder by Other Means: The Dispatcher, Book 2","titleShort":"Murder by Other Means"},{"added":348,"asin":"B074CKTHVJ","authors":[{"name":"Carol E.

Chet might have flunked out of police school (\"I'd been the best leaper in K-9 class, which had led to all the trouble in a way I couldn't remember exactly, although blood was involved\"), but he's a detective through and through. <p>In this, their first adventure, Chet and Bernie investigate the disappearance of Madison, a teenage girl who may or may not have been kidnapped, but who has definitely gotten mixed up with some very unsavory characters. A well-behaved, gifted student, she didn't arrive home after school and her divorced mother is frantic. Bernie is quick to take the case -- something about a cash flow problem that Chet's not all that clear about -- and he's relieved, if vaguely suspicious, when Madison turns up unharmed with a story that doesn't add up. But when she disappears for a second time in a week, Bernie and Chet aren't taking any chances; they launch a full-blown investigation. Without a ransom demand, they're not convinced it's a kidnapping, but they are sure of one thing: something smells funny.</p> <p>Their search for clues takes them into the desert to biker bars and other exotic locals, with Chet's highly trained nose leading the way. Both Chet and Bernie bring their own special skills to the hunt, one that puts each of them in peril. But even as the bad guys try to turn the tables, this duo is nothing if not resourceful, and the result is an uncommonly satisfying adventure.</p> <p>With his doggy ways and his endearingly hardboiled voice, Chet is full of heart and occasionally prone to mischief. He is intensely loyal to Bernie, who, though distracted by issues that Chet has difficulty understanding -- like divorce, child custody, and other peculiar human concerns -- is enormously likable himself, in his flawed, all-too-human way. </p>","title":"Dog on It: A Chet and Bernie Mystery","titleShort":"Dog on It"},{"added":336,"asin":"B07C2Z1XKL","authors":[{"name":"Dean Koontz","url":"B000APG4T6"}],"blurb":"An audio original novella featuring bestselling author Dean Koontz’s compelling new heroine, Jane Hawk.

On the distant planet Zarathustra, Jack is content as an independent contractor for ZaraCorp, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, that's not up for discussion. </p> <p>Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth. </p> <p>But there's another wrinkle to ZaraCorp's relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species. Then a small furry biped - trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute - shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family. As it dawns on Jack that despite their stature, these are people, he begins to suspect that ZaraCorp's claim to a planet's worth of wealth is very flimsy indeed and that ZaraCorp may stop at nothing to eliminate the fuzzys before their existence becomes more widely known.</p>","title":"Fuzzy Nation","titleShort":"Fuzzy Nation"},{"added":329,"asin":"B01AYKY8MQ","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Renshaw","url":"B00VWREVXW"}],"blurb":"When a high-ranking officer gallops into the quiet Mistyvales, he brings a warning that shakes the countryfolk to their roots....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"519Dsx0KNaL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"29h 30m","narrators":[{"name":"Tim Gerard Reynolds"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1774242672","authors":"Robert J.

His ambitious, multi-volume epics (<i>Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive</i>) and his stellar continuation of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In <i>Legion</i>, a distinctly contemporary novella filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson reveals a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent, read by Audie Award-winning narrator Oliver Wyman.</p> <p>Stephen Leeds, AKA 'Legion,' is a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills. As the story begins, Leeds and his 'aspects' are drawn into the search for the missing Balubal Razon, inventor of a camera whose astonishing properties could alter our understanding of human history and change the very structure of society. The action ranges from the familiar environs of America to the ancient, divided city of Jerusalem. Along the way, Sanderson touches on a formidable assortment of complex questions: the nature of time, the mysteries of the human mind, the potential uses of technology, and the volatile connection between politics and faith. Resonant, intelligent, and thoroughly absorbing, <i>Legion</i> is a provocative entertainment from a writer of great originality and seemingly limitless gifts.</p>","title":"Legion","titleShort":"Legion"},{"added":305,"asin":"B00IGI5UFI","authors":[{"name":"Anne Bishop","url":"B001IGV1EO"}],"blurb":"After winning the trust of the terra indigene residing in the Lakeside Courtyard, Meg Corbyn has had trouble figuring out what it means to live among them....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"cover":"51EAQYhcZjL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"9781101637944","type":"ISBN_13"},{"identifier":"1101637943","type":"ISBN_10"}],"language":"English","length":"14h 13m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"Alexandra Harris"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00RC4N15S","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"61y82uxCwwL","length":"16 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","subHeading":"A Novel of the Others","title":"Vision in Silver"},{"asin":"B01AIVUX4S","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"61K5CDI46-L","length":"15 hrs and 21 mins","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","subHeading":"A Novel of the Others, Book 4","title":"Marked in Flesh"},{"asin":"B01N6CD7L5","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51RGAkM4MUL","length":"16 hrs and 21 mins","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","subHeading":"A Novel of the Others","title":"Etched in Bone"},{"asin":"B075FCS4W7","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"61LxDcqNdzL","length":"13 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"Alexandra Harris","title":"Lake Silence"},{"asin":"B003C28KXM","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51a9Q3jgNdL","length":"16 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 1","title":"Daughter of the Blood"},{"asin":"B003LMNK2E","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51osFvwwzeL","length":"18 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 2","title":"Heir to the Shadows"},{"asin":"B003RCE1JY","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51b0IWE+jqL","length":"17 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 3","title":"Queen of the Darkness"},{"asin":"B0047AAR02","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51MdgLnqSAL","length":"16 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","title":"Dreams Made Flesh"},{"asin":"B0037M7YN4","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51YI+0ECXhL","length":"17 hrs and 11 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"Shalador's Lady"},{"asin":"B004NFB84U","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"71bo-V56yIL","length":"16 hrs and 23 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Book","title":"Twilight's Dawn"},{"asin":"B002V1A2WW","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51DgV3Dn5WL","length":"11 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"The Shadow Queen"},{"asin":"B00ISAC8XG","authors":"Ilona Andrews","cover":"51Wwl1GsG3L","length":"7 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"Renee Raudman","title":"Clean Sweep"},{"asin":"0593165586","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51ZVcKnUz7L","length":"14 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"Gary Littman","subHeading":"Black Jewels, Book 10","title":"The Queen's Bargain"},{"asin":"B002V1BNO8","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51UYUBGY0rL","length":"10 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"Tangled Webs"},{"asin":"B002V0KLAG","authors":"Anne Bishop","cover":"51FDK8FxIVL","length":"13 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"John Sharian","subHeading":"A Black Jewels Novel","title":"The Invisible Ring"},{"asin":"B01MYVARKX","authors":"Patricia Briggs","cover":"51I531UXpmL","length":"11 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Lorelei King, George Newbern","subHeading":"A Mercy Thompson Novel, Book 10","title":"Silence Fallen"},{"asin":"B002V1NIAU","authors":"Patricia Briggs","cover":"51JMK6w2rVL","length":"10 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"Holter Graham","title":"Cry Wolf"},{"asin":"B076VSNJSG","authors":"Patricia Briggs","cover":"61lbtJm4UtL","length":"9 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Holter Graham","title":"Burn Bright"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Penguin Audio"}],"rating":4.6,"ratings":4027,"releaseDate":"2014-03-04","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/002315/bk_peng_002315_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B00IIWA44O","bookNumbers":["2"],"name":"The Others (Bishop)"}],"storePageRequestUrl":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Murder-of-Crows-Audiobook/B00IGI5UFI","summary":"<p>Return to <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Anne Bishop’s \"phenomenal\" (<i>Urban Fantasy Investigations</i>) world of the Others - where supernatural entities and humans struggle to co-exist, and one woman has begun to change all the rules.… </p> <p>After winning the trust of the terra indigene residing in the Lakeside Courtyard, Meg Corbyn has had trouble figuring out what it means to live among them.

The dictatorial Augurs, once thought of almost as gods, were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. </p> <p>A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience. As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought--and lost--before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests. But when he discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. </p> <p>To the north an ancient enemy, long thought defeated, begins to stir.

It was the last thing we expected, but the world is freezing. A new ice age has dawned and humanity has been forced to confront its own extinction.

It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese. </p> <p>For six months things went well: He found a quaint little shop, he befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and, best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes. </p> <p>Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins - gurvani, they call themselves - bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy - and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: to hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins. </p> <p>When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: there are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies. </p> <p>Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you'll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins. </p> <p>All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker's son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger. </p>","title":"Spellmonger: Spellmonger, Book 1","titleShort":"Spellmonger"},{"added":241,"asin":"B0777TY894","authors":[{"name":"Jerry Merritt","url":"B00FAVK2Q6"}],"blurb":"When Micajah Fenton discovers a crater in his front yard with a broken time glider in the bottom and a naked, virtual woman on his lawn, he delays his plans to kill himself....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51oCDmdHz0L","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"0989432157","type":"ISBN_10"},{"identifier":"9780989432153","type":"ISBN_13"}],"language":"English","length":"11h 46m","narrators":[{"name":"Christopher Lane"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"154144065X","authors":"Victor Zugg","cover":"51n6KWDtKTL","length":"7 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Sean William Doyle","subHeading":"A Historical Novel of Survival","title":"A Ripple in Time"},{"asin":"B07CQ4325G","authors":"Jerry Merritt","cover":"518rIxPrLNL","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Emily Sutton-Smith","title":"Time Pebbles"},{"asin":"B077H492QG","authors":"Michelle Kidd","cover":"51LrL4v+41L","length":"11 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Megan Tusing","title":"Timeless Moments"},{"asin":"B002V5BHM2","authors":"Audrey Niffenegger","cover":"51tWSYoUrjL","length":"17 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"Fred Berman, Phoebe Strole","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife"},{"asin":"B00YHYDZGQ","authors":"Michael Z.

That’s a lot of mages, cybernetically enhanced chrome heads, and mythical beasties who die, get into debt, and otherwise fail to pay their rent. When they can’t pay their bills, their stuff gets sold to the highest bidder to cover the tab. </p> <p>That’s when they call me. My name is Opal Yong-ae, and I’m a Cleaner: a freelance mage with an art history degree who’s employed by the DFZ to sort through the mountains of magical junk people leave behind. It’s not a pretty job, or a safe one - there’s a reason I wear bite-proof gloves - but when you’re deep in debt in a lawless city where gods are real, dragons are traffic hazards, and buildings move around on their own, you don’t get to be picky about where your money comes from. You just have to make it work, even when the only thing of value in your latest repossessed apartment is the dead body of the mage who used to live there. </p> <p><i>Author’s note: </i>This is the first in a new series set in the same universe as my Heartstrikers books, but you don’t need to have heard those stories to enjoy this one. <i>Minimum Wage Magic </i>was written to stand by itself, so if you haven’t listened to the others, don’t worry!

Rowling and has raised money for her children’s charity Lumos ever since.</p> <p>As familiar to Hogwarts students as \"Cinderella\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" are to Muggle children, Beedle’s stories are a collection of popular fairy tales written for young witches and wizards. So, if you’re wondering what’s in store in this brand-new audio edition...well, your ears are in for a treat.</p> <p>Once you’ve checked this fabulous Hogwarts Library book out, you’ll start by hearing the author’s introduction, read by Sally Mortemore (librarian Madam Pince from the Harry Potter films). Then it’s time for the tales to begin....</p> <p>You’ll laugh along to \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" as you listen to the havoc wreaked by a father’s impish gift to his son, read by Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" will take you on a quest through an enchanted garden, alongside three witches and a luckless knight, read by Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>In \"The Warlock’s Hairy Heart\", you’ll be warned about a young warlock who is fearful of love and turns to dark magic to avoid it at all costs, read by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>The calamitous meeting of a foolish king, a cunning charlatan and a mischievous washerwoman unravels in \"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\", read by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley - Harry Potter).</p> <p>And finally, the most iconic of Beedle’s stories. \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" - with its message of humility and wisdom - will introduce you, dear listener, to the Deathly Hallows, read by Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger - <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>, London’s West End and New York’s Broadway).</p> <p>Each of the tales is accompanied by wise and whimsical notes from a certain Albus Dumbledore, surely everyone’s favourite headmaster, read by Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore - Fantastic Beasts films).</p> <p>We’re told these five fables have been firm favourites in wizarding households for centuries, and now it’s your turn to experience these tales from the Wizarding World, as you’ve never heard them before.</p> <p><i>At least 90 percent of the proceeds* received by Pottermore Limited from this audiobook will be made available by the publisher to The Lumos Foundation for their work to help children worldwide out of institutions, so they can thrive in loving families and communities. The Lumos Foundation is a charity registered in England and Wales with registered charity number 1112575.</i></p> <p>Around the world, more than eight million children live in orphanages and other institutions. What may be surprising is that about 80 percent of them aren’t actually orphans. They have family who could care for them, with the right support. Lumos is an international children’s charity founded by J.K. Rowling. Named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, Lumos’ mission is to ensure that by 2050 all children will grow up in loving, protective families.</p> <p>*Proceeds means the cash-price or cash-equivalent price less sales taxes and reasonable expenses. </p>","title":"The Tales of Beedle the Bard","titleShort":"The Tales of Beedle the Bard"},{"added":232,"asin":"B074GG7MT1","authors":[{"name":"Alexander C.

There's a really excellent reason for <i>Lock In</i> to have two entirely different versions, so when it came time to make the audiobook, Audible did an ingenious thing: they asked both Wil Wheaton and Amber Benson to record entire versions of the book. As the author, I’m impressed with Audible’s commitment to my narrative - and I’m geeking out that both Wil and Amber are reading my book. This is fantastic.\" (John Scalzi)</p> <p>A blazingly inventive near-future thriller from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi. </p> <p>Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever, and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge. </p> <p>A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome\", rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated. </p> <p>But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO</b>: Audible's audio edition of <i>Lock In</i> contains the bonus novella, <i>Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome</i>, written by John Scalzi and narrated by a full cast.</p>","title":"Lock In (Narrated by Amber Benson)","titleShort":"Lock In (Narrated by Amber Benson)"},{"added":229,"asin":"B004GHJMPW","authors":[{"name":"Faith Hunter","url":"B001IODHIE"}],"blurb":"Jane, a shapeshifting vampire-hunter-for-hire, crosses paths with a stranger who has arrived in New Orleans, enlisted to hunt vampires who have gone insane -

No one gets hurt, but the brutality is real, and the crowds love it. </p> <p>Until a star athlete drops dead on the playing field. </p> <p>Is it an accident or murder? FBI agents and Haden-related crime investigators Chris Shane and Leslie Vann are called in to uncover the truth - and in doing so travel to the darker side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost and where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field. </p>","title":"Head On (Narrated by Wil Wheaton)","titleShort":"Head On (Narrated by Wil Wheaton)"},{"added":220,"asin":"B00KYUYM14","authors":[{"name":"John Scalzi","url":"B001IGJOCA"}],"blurb":"A blazingly inventive near-future thriller from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"cover":"51dpLx8SEbL","downloaded":true,"favorite":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"9781429963602","type":"ISBN_13"},{"identifier":"1429963603","type":"ISBN_10"}],"language":"English","length":"9h 56m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"Wil Wheaton"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1O7D2","authors":"John Scalzi","cover":"517p2h5PdjL","length":"9 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"William Dufris","title":"Old Man's War"},{"asin":"B01L2PE1XI","authors":"John Scalzi","cover":"51iaZv0S0EL","length":"9 hrs and 24 mins","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","subHeading":"The Interdependency, Book 1","title":"The Collapsing Empire"},{"asin":"B004FGDVUG","authors":"John Scalzi","cover":"51T7ZRMC2YL","length":"10 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","title":"The Android's Dream"},{"asin":"B084RPCT73","authors":"John Scalzi","cover":"51ReJqB6qBL","length":"8 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","subHeading":"The Interdependency, Book 3","title":"The Last Emperox"},{"asin":"B019WULXBS","authors":"Stephen King","cover":"51H2SIfW0UL","length":"7 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Kevin Kenerly","title":"The Running Man"},{"asin":"B07ZJTBQ2Y","authors":"John Scalzi","cover":"61AAPvABXKL","length":"2 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Khristine Hvam, Dina Pearlman, Kevin T.

The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge. </p> <p>A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome\", rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated. </p> <p>But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it.

K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy.</p> <p>When Rin aced the Keju - the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies - it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard - the most elite military school in Nikan - was even more surprising.</p> <p>But surprises aren’t always good.</p> <p>Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the South is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power - an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive - and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.</p> <p>For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away....</p> <p>Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity...and that it may already be too late.</p> <p>R.F. Kuang studies modern Chinese history. She has a BA from Georgetown University and is currently a graduate student in the United Kingdom on a Marshall Scholarship. <i>The Poppy War </i>is her debut novel.</p>","title":"The Poppy War: A Novel","titleShort":"The Poppy War"},{"added":180,"asin":"B071D42T27","authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

This fantasy story has an amazing twist ending. </p> <p>The original Codex stories appeared in <i>The Crimson Pact</i> anthologies as <i>The Transition</i> and <i>The Merging</i>. These stories are connected to each other, and to <i>Failed Crusade</i> at their roots, but occur many years later. They follow an unsuspecting foreign exchange student named Sloan Boyle. A seemingly innocent interaction with a stranger in a Spanish Cafe leads to a dangerous series of events, and a weighty discovery that threatens everything Sloan ever knew about this world and his role in it. </p> <p><i>Club PK2</i> is written in the same Codex universe as the other stories but is a separate adventure with distinct characters. The voice is reminiscent of <i>Supernatural</i>. It follows a hardened cop named Tray sent undercover on special assignment to expose a dangerous underground fight club. The cop discovers much more than a bunch of thugs trying to make a buck, and he learns something about The Codex, and the demon's master plan in the process. </p> <p>P.S. </p> <p>The Codex ended up playing a pivotal role in the final story, <i>Sealed with Fire</i>.

This changed forever when an actor-turned-fugitive, Teddy Kyle Smith, had an encounter that brought Iñukuns from myth to reality. Smith was an aspiring actor with a promising career until it all came quickly crashing down with a gunshot, a manhunt, bloodshed, and other frightful events.</p> <p>The story of Smith’s tragic downfall has long haunted James Dommek, Jr., the great-grandson of the last of the Iñupiaq story-tellers. <i>Midnight Son</i> is his journey in discovering who Teddy Kyle Smith was, what he did, and what he really saw.

When she has a hunch about an ongoing murder investigation, she knows it could be her only chance to prove herself and truly break into the “boys' club” of Dublin’s police force. </p> <p> Carrie uncovers this make-or-break moment in a case file that her sister Aifric, a newly qualified barrister, leaves on their kitchen counter: Robert Collins has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend after a fight in a local pub. All signs point toward a guilty verdict, but both sisters quickly begin to find evidence that complicates the story. All the while, Carrie is very aware that she’s crossed the line—if the detective sergeant running the investigation finds out she’s been messing around with his case, her career will be over before it has begun. Aoife McMahon lends her authentic accent and her knowledge of the series’ characters, delivering a powerful performance that heightens the drama with every twist and turn. </p> <p><b>Please note: This audio contains strong language, distressing situations, and descriptions of violence that some listeners may find upsetting.

James portrays every character in a small Jersey Shore town as he unravels the story of Leonard Pelkey, a tenaciously optimistic and flamboyant 14-year-old boy who has gone missing. A luminous force of nature whose magic is only truly felt once he is gone, Leonard becomes an unexpected inspiration as the town’s citizens question how they live, who they love, and what they leave behind. </p> <p>Brash detective Chuck DeSantis seeks out answers as to why Leonard is missing.

R. James.</p> <p><i>Casting the Runes</i> - adapted by Stephen Gallagher</p> <p>When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - <i>The Truth of Alchemy</i>, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.   </p> <p>On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: 'In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.' Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse? </p> <p><i>Lost Hearts</i> - adapted by A. K. Benedict</p> <p>Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.</p> <p><i>The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas</i> - adapted by Jonathan Barnes</p> <p>When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.</p> <p><i>A View from a Hill </i>- adapted by Mark Morris</p> <p>Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill.</p>","title":"The Conception of Terror: Tales Inspired by M. R.

I don't know why.\" But they do try to communicate, with a short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, Stormy Llewellyn. <p> Maybe he has a gift, maybe it's a curse, Odd has never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out. Sometimes they want justice, and Odd's otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one. But this time it's different.</p> <p> A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite, a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants, not even Odd's deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15. </p> <p> Today is August 14.</p> <p> In less than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe. As evil coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll. His account of two shattering days when past and present, fate and destiny converge is the stuff of our worst nightmares, and a testament by which to live: sanely if not safely, with courage, humor, and a full heart that even in the darkness must persevere.</p>","title":"Odd Thomas","titleShort":"Odd Thomas"},{"added":142,"asin":"B00M1YYF22","authors":[{"name":"Benedict Jacka","url":"B0034OYL22"}],"blurb":"Camden, North London: A tangled, mangled junction of train lines, roads and waterways....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61yY4vEKp+L","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"9780748124916","type":"ISBN_13"},{"identifier":"0748124918","type":"ISBN_10"}],"language":"English","length":"10h 33m ","narrators":[{"name":"Gildart Jackson"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"0593343050","authors":"Jim Butcher","cover":"5111yqXG8KL","length":"15 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"James Marsters","subHeading":"Dresden Files, Book 17","title":"Battle Ground"},{"asin":"B00X7Z70QW","authors":"Benedict Jacka","cover":"61gV12wAooL","length":"10 hrs and 3 mins","narrators":"Gildart Jackson","subHeading":"An Alex Verus Novel","title":"Cursed"},{"asin":"B00X98UTRE","authors":"Benedict Jacka","cover":"61ietyPHDuL","length":"10 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Gildart Jackson","subHeading":"An Alex Verus Novel","title":"Taken"},{"asin":"B00JRGQHUU","authors":"Paul Cornell","cover":"51iX9AjPOuL","length":"13 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Damian Lynch","subHeading":"The Shadow Police, Book One","title":"London Falling"},{"asin":"0593290704","authors":"Jim Butcher","cover":"51fO-ekMn2L","length":"12 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"James Marsters","subHeading":"Dresden Files, Book 16","title":"Peace Talks"},{"asin":"B08PDM5DF6","authors":"John Conroe","cover":"616XFsDMMpL","length":"7 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"James Patrick Cronin","subHeading":"Stories from the Demon Accords Universe","title":"The Demon Accords Compendium, Volume 3"},{"asin":"B007V55FJ8","authors":"Kevin Hearne","cover":"513zwrFd1-L","length":"10 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 4","title":"Tricked"},{"asin":"B017WQALGM","authors":"Kevin Hearne","cover":"61s9Za+blKL","length":"11 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 8","title":"Staked"},{"asin":"B00JV2RPQ0","authors":"Kevin Hearne","cover":"61o3FlyA1xL","length":"12 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 7","title":"Shattered"},{"asin":"B009M7IPHC","authors":"Tad Williams","cover":"51TZLRomOcL","length":"15 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"George Newbern","subHeading":"Bobby Dollar, Book 1","title":"The Dirty Streets of Heaven"},{"asin":"B00CP5CC9U","authors":"Kevin Hearne","cover":"61cU362ZksL","length":"9 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book 6","title":"Hunted"},{"asin":"0593213882","authors":"Kevin Hearne","cover":"61wJE3sXzeL","length":"10 hrs and 11 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"From the World of the Iron Druid Chronicles","title":"Ink & Sigil"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio UK"}],"rating":4.3,"ratings":101,"releaseDate":"2014-09-02","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/twuk/000838/bk_twuk_000838_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B00HNEIY2C","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"Alex Verus"}],"storePageRequestUrl":"https://www.audible.com/pd/Fated-Audiobook/B00M1YYF22","summary":"<p>Camden, North London: A tangled, mangled junction of train lines, roads, and waterways.

But any adult knows that our work anxieties and shameful memories would rather stay up all night and chat.

A middle-aged man is haunted by the voices of his own aging body.

The first complication is an unmistakable sign of sinister agendas afoot: a squirrel atop the train. But an even more ominous situation is in store when the trio plus Atticus stumble across a murder upon arrival at the station. They recognize Detective Gabriela Ibarra, who's there to investigate. But they also recognize the body - or rather that the body is a doppelganger for Atticus himself. </p> <p>The police, hampered by human senses of smell and a decided lack of canine intuition, obviously can't handle this alone. Not with Atticus likely in danger. Oberon knows it's time to investigate once more - for justice! For gravy! And possibly greasy tacos! </p> <p>Alongside his faithful Druid, Oberon and the other loyal hounds navigate by nose through Portland to find a bear-shifter friend with intel, delicious clues at the victim's home, and more squirrels. Always more squirrels! </p> <p>But will our hungry band of heroes be able to identify the culprit before someone else is murdered?

Now he's got company. Atticus's apprentice Granuaile is finally a full Druid herself. What's more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern name Owen Kennedy.

Between busting Atticus's chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the jury's still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god Loki - or merely a pain in the arse.

When it comes to finding cheating spouses, corporate thieves, or runaway teenagers, he’s unenthusiastic, and unmatched. As a former San Francisco detective, he misses more meaningful work, but he hasn’t had the heart for it since his wife’s death five years prior. That is, until a phone call from a distraught mother, an illegal immigrant who can’t go to the police, puts him on the hunt for a missing little girl.</p> <p>By the time he reaches the mother’s small home, she’s missing, too. The circumstances are strange, but when a team of heavily armed mercenaries arrive, Delgado is convinced there is more going on than a simple kidnapping.</p> <p>Joined by his wise-cracking elderly assistant, a gun-toting pastor, and a UFO enthusiast Uber driver, Delgado follows the clues west, to Colorado City, a town cleaved in two by the 37th parallel, also known as the UFO Highway. In a town infamous for fundamentalist Mormon cult activity, they uncover evidence of a massive child-trafficking ring whose ringleaders might not be human.</p> <p>Delgado and crew are plunged into a dangerous world of corporate competition, UFO lore, and government cover-ups. While they hunt for answers, they’re pursued across the Southwest by high-tech mercs, brainwashed cults, and beings whose true identity has been concealed since 1947.</p> <p><b>...he must risk the world.</b></p> <p>UFOs and alien abductions remain some of the most hotly debated and mysterious subjects of the 21st century. In the decades since 1960, with reports of strange encounters on the rise, 13 million people have gone missing worldwide and never been found. <i>The Others</i> takes a fast-paced, unique, and moving look at the phenomenon that has fueled Jeremy Robinson’s imagination since several sightings, strange happenings, and visits with renowned UFO investigator and family friend Raymond Fowler. </p>","title":"The Others","titleShort":"The Others"},{"added":77,"asin":"B07C7S798P","authors":[{"name":"D.

It's perfectly safe</b>. </p> <p>The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn't much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he's content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve. </p> <p>Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind's dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn't quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. </p> <p>As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there's only one answer that makes sense.

Andy soon finds himself immersed in a world where not everyone is human, and a late-night visit to a churchyard nearly results in grave consequences, and a ghoulish outcome. An accidental fire leads to Andy having to doss in Hobbes's spare room. </p> <p>Contending with a wave of murder, suicide, and robbery, as well as Hobbes's weirdness, is the just the start; he must also get to grips with Mrs. Goodfellow, Hobbes's housekeeper, who collects teeth. Although they are mostly from humans, she also claims to have some vampire specimens. However, Andy soon finds her wonderful cooking compensates for her eccentricities. Despite Andy believing he is coping, he is nearly unhinged by horror when a stressed Hobbes's concealed nature reveals itself in an orgy of bone-crunching. Yet, coming through unscathed, Andy develops respect and admiration for his host, even when he uses weird, occasionally brutal, methods to begin unravelling the mystery, which would appear to link The Order of the Dragon and Vlad Tepes, the original Dracula, to the crime wave. </p> <p>When Hobbes goes missing, Andy, with the dubious assistance of Dregs, Hobbes's big, bad dog, and armed with a leg of lamb, searches for him. Will he triumph over crazed blood lust and human sacrifice? </p> <p>Can Andy with Hobbes's friends, a binge-drinking dwarf and a troll who looks uncannily human, save the day?

His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old - when in actuality, he's twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer. </p> <p>Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he's hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power - plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish - to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil. </p> <p>This is book one of the Iron Druid Chronicles series.

Well, I don't know if you'd call it work, but that's where I found it. It's the lost journal of Nikola Tesla, one of the greatest inventors and visionaries ever. Before he died in 1943, he kept a notebook filled with spectacular claims and outrageous plans. One of these plans was for an “INTERDIMENSIONAL TRANSFER APPARATUS\" - that allowed someone (in this case me and my friend Pete) to travel to other versions of the infinite possibilities around us. Crazy, right? But that's just where the crazy starts.\" </p> <p><b>Chip's Official Disclaimer</b>: This is a work of fiction. The events depicted in the collection of emails did not happen. I have never been in contact with a covert government group attempting to suppress knowledge of the lost journal of Nikola Tesla. I have not been threatened with death if I divulge the secrets contained inside. They did not buy me this handsome jacket (oh crap, you're listening to this - trust me, it looks great on me). They did not come to my place, and liquor me up, and offer to publish this book as a sci-fi comedy novel to throw the public off the trail of the real truth. </p> <p>Or did they? </p> <p>I'm kidding.

The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: She must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money. </p> <p>Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace - the world's fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it's up to Tristan to find out why. </p> <p>And so the Department of Diachronic Operations - D.O.D.O. - gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive...and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial - and treacherous - nature of the human heart. </p> <p>Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson's work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland's storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible and take you to places - and times - beyond imagining. </p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Robert Fass, James Foster, Tavia Gilbert, Arthur Morey, David Stifel, Charlie Thurston, and Kate Udall. </p>","title":"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.: A Novel","titleShort":"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O."},{"added":5,"asin":"B0711L56NR","authors":[{"name":"Leonard Goldberg","url":"B001JXCXDY"}],"blurb":"Joanna Blalock's keen mind and incredible insight lead her to become a highly skilled nurse, one of the few professions that allow her to use her finely tuned brain....","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"cover":"51I8xisuTvL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isbns":[{"identifier":"9781250101051","type":"ISBN_13"},{"identifier":"1250101050","type":"ISBN_10"}],"language":"English","length":"9h 36m ","narrators":[{"name":"Steve West"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07DLDWMGG","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51ELJj49J5L","length":"8 hrs and 40 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery, Book 2","title":"A Study in Treason"},{"asin":"1250223970","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51z5pgoDl6L","length":"8 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery, Book 3","title":"The Disappearance of Alistair Ainsworth"},{"asin":"B004DQY6F2","authors":"Graham Moore","cover":"51n1fPFw7GL","length":"11 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"James Langton","title":"The Sherlockian"},{"asin":"1250751756","authors":"Leonard Goldberg","cover":"51ysyp+Y2kL","length":"9 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Steve West","subHeading":"A Daughter of Sherlock Holmes Mystery","title":"The Art of Deception"},{"asin":"B007NK9YGG","authors":"Susan Elia MacNeal","cover":"519Bi29oylL","length":"9 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Donada Peters","subHeading":"A Maggie Hope Mystery","title":"Mr. Churchill's Secretary"},{"asin":"B008DJED76","authors":"Agatha Christie","cover":"61nBUX9bR+L","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Hugh Fraser","subHeading":"A Harley Quin Collection","title":"The Mysterious Mr. Quin"},{"asin":"B084T5J52D","authors":"Rhys Bowen","cover":"51EpH6SLTWL","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Jasmine Blackborow","subHeading":"Royal Spyness, Book 14","title":"The Last Mrs. Summers"},{"asin":"0063028093","authors":"Agatha Christie","cover":"51fGHRz3CcL","length":"16 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Hugh Fraser, Emilia Fox","subHeading":"Two Bestselling Agatha Christie Novels in One Great Audiobook","title":"The Secret of Chimneys & A Murder Is Announced"},{"asin":"B08GG1YM7M","authors":"H.Y.
